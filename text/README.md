# text.mew151.net

I host text-only versions of my website alongside the main HTML version. Some of the content is automatically generated from the HTML found in the rest of the repo. The rest can be found in the `gemini` and `gopher` directories.

The `www` folder here contains the HTML page that is used on the HTTP version found at https://text.mew151.net.
