iMew151's Phlog

iThis is my phlog. Sometimes it will be a mirror of my WWW blog.
iSometimes smaller unique posts will find there way here. Hope you enjoy!

iYou may see me refer to this as my "gemlog". That's because generally this
icontent is mirrored on both Gemini *and* Gopher. Typically I write for Gemini
ifirst (since it has a bit more fancy extra formatting) and then downgrade the
icontent to plain text. So if you see that... that's why. Maybe I'll
ioccasionally post stuff exclusive to Gopher here though. Idk.
