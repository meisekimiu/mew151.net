# About

Welcome to the text version of my site! While my main website (https://mew151.net) is the main space that I want to represent my internet presence in, I understand that some people don't really like the idea of distracting images, goofy layouts trying to look like old Windows UIs, and (harmless, I swear!) JavaScript code running in the background while they load each new page.

While I like all the weird web-core stuff I have going on in my website, I also like the idea of the low-tech, text-based internet protocols like Gemini and Gopher. I too think the internet is bloated, and setting up a presence on these alternate protocols sounds super fun! So that is what I've done here. Hope you enjoy! This site is mostly an abridged version of my main website, lacking a lot of pages that really only work on the web. But I think I'm going to post some exclusive content here just for the fun of it!

Anyways, thanks for checking out my page! What follows is just a copy/paste from my WWW site lol.

Hi, I'm Natalie! If you're into ~cooler internet aliases~ instead, you can call me "Mew". Like the domain name! I'm a professional software engineer and hobbyist game developer. I currently do professional work with modern web technologies, and working on this site is a great break from all of that stuff! I believe in free and open source software, and yes, I use Linux.

I love anime, especially idol anime! (My producer name is "MewP"). I'm also a Lucid Dreamer. I love weird avant-garde music (specifically from The Residents or anyone else related to Ralph Records). Also I love rhythm games. I currently play two musical instruments, both of which I love: Accordion and EWI.

By the way, my favorite Pokémon is obviously Mew, though Oddish is my favorite non-legendary Pokémon.
