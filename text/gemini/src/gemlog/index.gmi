# Mew151's Gemlog

This is my Gemlog. Sometimes it will be a mirror of my WWW blog. Sometimes smaller unique posts will find their way here. Hope you enjoy!

You may see me refer to this as my "phlog". That's because generally this content is mirrored on both Gemini *and* Gopher. But typically I write for Gemini first and then copy over to Gopher so that should never happen. lol.

(remind me to make an RSS feed for this eventually lol)
