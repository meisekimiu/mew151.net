          <h1>Perfect Pop Star Academy</h1>
          <h2>(My Blog)</h2>
        </div>
        <p><em>Perfect Pop Star Academy</em> is my personal blog, started in 2017. After <a href="/about.html" title="TLDR i didn't use this domain and site for like almost a whole decade lol">not using my website</a> for years, I decided I finally wanted to add <em>some</em> personal content to it. This took the form of a blog.</p>

        <p>I really wanted to do more with <em>Perfect Pop Star Academy.</em> My original plan for the blog was to be a site dedicated to the genre of idol anime, including episode-by-episode reviews of certain shows where I'd post screenshots, make observations, and type up witty jokes. That ended up being <em>way</em> more work than I thought, and the test posts I made didn't even end up being that good.</p>

        <p>The second plan for <em>Perfect Pop Star Academy</em> was that I'd post <q>Game Features</q> to it, where I'd review and talk about mostly obscure games that I found interesting. I did end up writing one review, but the other test posts I started have yet to be finished and posted.</p>

        <p>I'm hoping that my current personal website ends up fulfilling the roles I had initially envisioned for <em>Perfect Pop Star Academy,</em> while the blog itself can continue being the one thing it's good at: being a general blog.</p>

        <p>The blog itself was once powered by a custom built blogging software, but in this site's redesign I have simplified the blog to static HTML as well, porting most of the older entries over to this new static blog.</p>
