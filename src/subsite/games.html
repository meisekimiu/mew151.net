            My <q>Gamez Archive</q> site is a website developed to (hopefully
            one day) document and preserve all the video games I've ever made.
            Even the cringy ones. <em>Especially</em> the cringy ones.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike a professional portfolio, the Gamez Archive is meant to
            catalog both my modern games as well as games I made when I was a
            literal child. I think it's really satisfying to see my growth as a
            developer, and it's fun to try to connect the dots between then and
            now. There are a lot of shared aspects between my games that can be
            appreciated when the whole story is actually shown.
          </p>

          <p>
            Given what I just said about portfolios, it's ironic that the Gamez
            Archive website actually has its roots in a portfolio website I made
            as part of a high school
            <span title="Game and Design">Game Design &amp; Development</span>
            class. A lot of the basic format is actually borrowed from that
            earlier portfolio. And any screenshots I took for that original site
            were completely reused in the Gamez Archive website (which is why
            you'll occasionally see Windows XP/7 in the screenshots). I really
            enjoyed making that original portfolio website, and the Gamez
            Archive is essentially its evolved form. I think younger me would
            actually be pretty excited that at least some form of the original
            portfolio is now publicly accessible on the World Wide Web. :)
          </p>

            The Gamez Archive first went up in 2021 and is powered by
            <a
              href="https://zonelets.net/"
              title="they should have gotten the domain zonelets.zone"
              >Zonelets,</a
            >
            <span title="in hindsight I should have made it a wiki"
              >despite not actually being a blog.</span
            >
            I think it was one of the first steps I made to reviving my interest
            in cozy personal websites
          </p>
