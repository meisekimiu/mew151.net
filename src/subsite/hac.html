            <h1>Home Age Conversations</h1>
            <h2>A Podcast About The Residents</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            <em>Home Age Conversations</em> <span title="was???">is</span> a
            podcast about the anonymous art band The Residents. The first
            episode was posted in December of 2018 and was even promoted by The
            Residents themselves. Podcasts need to be hosted
            <em>somewhere</em> and so I developed a complete site for the
            podcast, linked below.
          </p>

          <p>
            Originally the site was hosted on a subdomain of my
            <em>mew151.net</em> domain. Once a few episodes came out, and the
            show was serious, I helped them move to a separate domain.
          </p>

          <p>
            As of March 2020, <em>Home Age Conversations</em> is currently on
            hiatus. The chaos of the year 2020 seriously disrupted the
            production of the show. However, I don't think the show is
            completely dead, and
            <span
              title="At the very least, we have like 3.5 episodes recorded that just haven't been posted"
              >I'd like to see it return one day. :)</span
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Home Age Conversations</em> acted as a spiritual successor to
            another officially unofficial Residents podcast,
            <em>The Residents BOGcast.</em> For the first one-and-a-half
            episodes of <abbr title="Home Age Conversations">HAC,</abbr> we had
            Sparky, the host of the BOGcast, act as a sort of advisor for the
            show. He later took on the role of producer for the podcast with the
            second episode.
          </p>

          <p>
            My favorite episode of theirs is the
            <em>River of Crime</em> episode. Bonus fun fact: Home Age
            Conversations was featured in The Residents' encyclopedia
            <a
              href="https://meettheresidents.fandom.com/wiki/Faceless_Forever_(book)"
              title="I'm a proud server host :')"
              ><em>Faceless Forever.</em></a
