            If so, that means you have come across a wild RSS feed! RSS is an
            important part of the world wide web, but as time has marched onward
            it has visibly disappeared from a lot of sites. This page is all
            about RSS and hopefully if you aren't already a fan of RSS, I can
            convince you to start subscribing to RSS feeds by the end of it!
          </p>
          <h2 id="what-is-rss">What is RSS?</h2>
          <p>
            RSS
            <span title="random selection of syllables"
              ><small>(what it stands for depends on who you ask)</small></span
            >
            is a format for defining a feed of web content. The main idea behind
            RSS is that websites can host their RSS feeds and push out updates
            to subscribers. Subscribers can see updates appear on their feeds
            without having to pull up the main website.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main prototypical usage for RSS feeds is for something like news
            websites. Instead of having to navigate through the front page,
            users can plug a news website's RSS feed into a
            <strong>feed reader</strong> and get headlines or even full articles
            delivered to them in a more efficient way, potentially without even
            opening their internet browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically feed readers will automatically check for updates and
            notify the user when a feed has been updated, so the user doesn't
            have to manually check all their favorite sites on their own.
          </p>
          <p>
            An RSS feed itself is just a specific kind of XML file. If you're
            not familiar with XML, it's similar to HTML but with different tag
            names. Many sites automatically generate RSS feeds in some way, but
            it's not that hard to upload and maintain a handwritten RSS feed
            onto your website.
          </p>
          <h2 id="why-use-rss">Why use RSS?</h2>
          <p>
            I'm sure the idea of users "subscribing to" (or perhaps "following")
            a feed sounds familiar to you. One reason why RSS faded away is that
            other kinds of feeds showed up on the internet: social media in
            particular. Why link people to a weird XML file when you can just
            tell them to follow you on Twitter?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span
              title="This also applies to free-to-use public APIs which are now dying out as well."
            >
              As the web became more monetized, RSS also became a way to avoid
              ads. Its goal of allowing website content to be "syndicated" to
              other contexts such as feed readers meant that users could have a
              lot more control over the specific web content they wanted to see.
              Skipping the front page of a website means losing precious
              engagement and ad clicks.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p><strong>And this is why I think RSS is so important.</strong></p>
          <p>
            RSS is a decentralized way to subscribe to web content. It is the
            way any website lets you "follow" or "subscribe" without having to
            go through social media. I love the
            <a href="https://indieweb.org" title="&lt;3" data-gmi-drop-link
              >IndieWeb</a
            >
            and Neocities, but modern social media has trained us all to
            <em>follow</em> other user's feeds. Having to go back to manually
            check all your favorite sites is an <em>awful</em> experience. RSS
            enables us to subscribe to sites like they're social media
            <em>without</em> using social media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another plus side: Usually, you do not have to create an account to
            subscribe to a website's RSS feed. Unlike corporate social media,
            RSS feeds also don't have any form of ads or other engagement
            algorithms tied to them. If you subscribe to an RSS feed, you won't
            ever have to stress about having this new subscription messing with
            your recommendation algorithm... because there is no algorithm in
            RSS. It's just a bunch of XML files hosted on different websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because feeds are decentralized, you also don't have to worry about
            <em>all</em> of your feeds going down at once. That also means
            <em>anyone</em> can host an RSS feed, and websites can even have as
            many feeds on them as they want; they just have to create a new XML
            file (for instance
            <a
              href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10628494"
              title="I wanted to actually fetch this feed with JavaScript and embed the headlines in this very article to prove a point about RSS but CORS stopped me."
              data-gmi-drop-link
              >BBC News</a
            >
            has many different RSS feeds for various news categories).
          </p>
          <p>
            I think RSS is especially important for one of my favorite things on
            the world wide web: small personal websites.
            <span
              title="realistically they might post updates on their personal account but do I want to follow someone's whole personal account just to get updates on their website?"
              >A typical tiny website isn't necessarily going to be posting
              updates on Twitter.</span
            >
            Even on a platform like Neocities that does offer a follow function
            and an automatically generated feed of site updates,
            <em>you still have to register for an account.</em> And you
            <em>still</em> have to check your Neocities home feed every time you
            want to get updates on Neocities sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            In theory, RSS allows you to subscribe to all of your web things in
            one place. You can get the latest news headlines, see the newest
            podcast episodes, and find out that a random website you subscribed
            to finally had its first update in years... all in your feed reader!
            For free! With no ads!
          </p>
          <p>
            And yes, you can subscribe to any podcast via RSS,
            <span title='"Wait it&apos;s RSS?" "Always has been"'
              >since podcasts actually just <em>are</em> RSS feeds.</span
            >

            I honestly am not an expert in feed readers. I strongly suggest you
            just do a web search for "RSS feed readers"; there are many to
            choose from. There are both desktop and mobile clients, as well as
            browser extensions.

            I personally use
            <a

              title="Feedbruh"

              >Feedbro for Firefox</a
            >
            as my current RSS feed reader and I think it's perfectly suitable.
            <span
              title="Well sync them in a similarly decentralized way to RSS. I'm sure if I actually enabled Firefox syncing between devices this wouldn't be an issue, but I'd love to import all my feed settings into a completely different feed reader on my phone or something like that."

              sync my RSS feeds between devices,</span
            >
            so currently my RSS reader is only available to me on my desktop
            computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            If anyone has other suggestions for good RSS readers, feel free to
            reach out and I'll add some to this section!
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, RSS readers can't do much if you can't find any feeds to
            follow. Typically you'll just want to keep your eyes peeled for that
            orange RSS icon for your best way to find a feed; most of the time
            near other social media buttons if it is there at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the best ways I've been able to find RSS feeds is by using a
            browser extension to help me find them. There are
            <a
              href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-feed-reader/pnjaodmkngahhkoihejjehlcdlnohgmp"
              data-gmi-footnote="RSS Feed Reader Extension for Google Chrome"
              >many,</a
            >
            <a
              href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/livemarks/"
              data-gmi-footnote="Livemarks Extension for Mozilla Firefox"
              >many</a
            >
            browser extensions that allow you to find RSS feeds while you're
            surfing the web. Most websites with feeds typically have a hidden
            piece of metadata defined in their HTML document that actually links
            to the RSS feed and these extensions just expose these links to the
            user. This is especially helpful on sites like Youtube that have RSS
            functionality but otherwise obfuscate it from the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also use certain services to generate feeds from social
            media to RSS feeds. For example, if you want to follow a certain
            user from Twitter on an RSS feed, you can subscribe to an RSS feed
            generated by
            <a
              href="https://nitter.net/about"
              title="I'm going to be honest the name of this service has potential for catastrophic typos"
              data-gmi-drop-link
              >Nitter</a
            >
            by plugging <kbd>https://nitter.net/{USERNAME}/rss</kbd> into your
            feed reader, substituting <kbd>{USERNAME}</kbd> for the user's
            Twitter username.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another admittedly naive way to find RSS feeds is just guessing:
            sometimes you can find a feed at <kbd>/rss.xml</kbd> or
            <kbd>/feed.xml</kbd> on a site, or by appending <kbd>.rss</kbd> to
            the end of a page's URL, although this is not guaranteed to work at
            all. And sometimes when it does work you're essentially hitting an
            undocumented feature of whatever web app you're using.
          </p>
          <p>
            When in doubt, always do a web search to see if a specific
            platform/website supports RSS! A lot of social media on the
            fediverse (sites like Mastodon, etc) have native support for RSS but
            it's not always well documented.
          </p>
          <h2>How can I make an RSS feed for my website?</h2>
          <p>
            Want to host your own RSS feed? Ultimately it's just a matter of
            making an XML file that conforms to the
            <a
              href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html"
              title="okay according to the W3C RSS actually does canonically stand for Really Simple Syndication. this is an L for Rich Site Summary fans everywhere"
              data-gmi-footnote
              >RSS specification.</a
            >
            ... Okay that spec is a bit dense if you're a beginner. I highly
            recommend checking out an
            <a
              href="https://www.mnot.net/rss/tutorial/"
              title="I just did a web search for RSS tutorial. This one is really good though."
              data-gmi-footnote="mark nottingham: RSS and Atom Feed Tutorial"
              >RSS tutorial</a
            >
            on the web if you've never written one before. It's a bit tricky at
            first if you're new to web development since RSS's XML syntax is a
            bit more strict than HTML, but it's easy once you get a hang of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are writing your own RSS feed, I highly recommend using an
            <a
              href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-validator/"
              title="This is for your RSS feed btw. You are already valid &lt;3"
              data-gmi-footnote="Official RSS Validator"
              >RSS validator</a
            >
            to make sure that your feed is valid. If you make a mistake in your
            feed, RSS feed readers might not be able to parse your feed. :(
          </p>
          <p>
            If writing your own feed sounds scary, there are ways to generate an
            RSS feed automatically. Some hosts/backends like
            <span
              title="I swear I am not sponsored unlike most youtube videos that mention squarespace or wix"
              >WordPress, Squarespace, and Wix</span
            >
            provide feeds automatically. Also, Neocities provides very basic RSS
            feeds automatically, although I think the feature needs work since
            it doesn't provide any descriptions in the feed at all. You can
            access a Neocities site's RSS feed by locating its profile and
            clicking the "Share" button. The first option should be
            <q>RSS/Atom Feed</q> which will link to an RSS feed for that site.
            For example, you can
            <a
              href="https://neocities.org/site/mew151.rss"
              title="please do not subscribe to this"
              data-gmi-footnote="My autogenerated Neocities RSS Feed"
              >check out my automatically generated Neocities RSS feed,</a
            >
            although I recommend you subscribe to the feeds I made for my site
            instead.

          <p>
            Please use RSS if you can. It's a small, kind of nerdy thing, but
            open technologies like these keep the web free, convenient, and
            accessible to others. Don't rely on centralized social media feeds
            to keep track of everything on the web. When you use RSS, you're
            supporting a free, decentralized, and independent web instead of the
            modern corporate hellscape a lot of the internet is today.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have ever resonated with any form of
            <a
              href="manifesto.html"
              title="Take the web back!"
              data-gmi-drop-link
              >internet manifesto,</a
            >
            or even written one yourself, then RSS is a tool that probably
            aligns with your interests. It is a rejection of modern social media
            and the monetized corporate web. It embraces interoperability, open
            standards, accessiblity, customization, and so much more. Use RSS
            and take web syndication back from corporate social media!
