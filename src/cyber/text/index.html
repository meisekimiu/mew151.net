            A lot of personal websites, especially on Neocities, tend to be
            intentionally "retro" and nostalgic. While some of it is either
            blind nostalgia or younger people fixating on an aesthetic
            ("webcore?"), I think a lot of the retro spirit on Neocities comes
            from the simple desire to escape the bad parts of the modern web and
            focus on a simpler and often better time. We create retraux personal
            websites to defy the modern, polished, algorithmic, corporate web.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, the internet didn't start with Geocities. So if we
            <span title="to play the shitty games that suck ass?"
              >really wanted to go back to the past,</span
            >
            we could go back even further and make our sites even simpler.
            Neocities sites are basic and static, but with all of the silly
            things we like to put on our sites like giant images, media players,
            scripts, and hundreds of GIFs per page,
            <span
              title="especially because Neocities just. goes down sometimes for like a whole day."
              >page load times can still be a problem.</span

          </p>
          <p>
            Because of this perceived heaviness of the web, there's been a
            small, but passionate revival of simple text-based internet
            technology. No images, videos, music, or even formatting. I was
            skeptical about all this when I heard about it at first, but
            eventually I kind of grew fascinated by these technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            While there are serious limitations compared to hypertext on the
            Web, there's a lot to like about simple text-based internet as well.
            It's super fast and lightweight. Text-based internet is smaller, so
            it should in theory use less energy to serve and browse. And... it
            just kind of has a cool hacker vibe to it!
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm pretty new to all this stuff, but I'm excited to explore it
            more! So this document is all about my exploration in the realms of
            two text-based protocols: Gopher and Gemini.
          </p>

          <h2 id="gopher">The Gopher Protocol</h2>

          <p>
            Gopher is an <em>old</em> technology. It's about as old as the very
            beginnings of the World Wide Web and it shows. Gopher is kind of
            like a version of the web that's more oriented around browsing
            directories and their files.
          </p>
          <p>
            While you can program a Gopher server to do some wild stuff, the
            protocol itself is still built around displaying directory listings
            and files. When you visit someone's Gopher site (a "gopherhole"?),
            most of the time the directory listings and files thing is pretty
            apparent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because Gopher sites are often lists of files, you'll find a lot of
            content can be literally in the form of <kbd>TXT</kbd> files that
            are uploaded to the server. Since Gopher does not contain any
            formatting abilities, if you are uploading an article that doesn't
            contain any links or dynamic content, it's easier to just write it
            out as a <kbd>TXT</kbd> file and upload it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of the lowtech vibes as well as the way that most Gopher
            servers tend to have directories of random files you can just
            browse, I feel like Gopher really has this "hacker" vibe to it
            that's pretty cool. Because Gopher is so old, you can access modern
            Gopher servers on very old computer systems, which is also really
            neat.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can access my Gopher site at
            <a href="gopher://text.mew151.net" data-gmi-footnote
              >gopher://text.mew151.net</a
            >. You will need a compatible Gopher client to visit it.
          </p>

          <h2 id="gemini">Project Gemini</h2>
          <p>
            While Gopher is really old, Gemini is really new. You could call it
            a modern version of Gopher, but I think there are enough differences
            to make it its own thing as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gemini is focused more on making actual "sites" instead of just
            directory listings. This makes it feel a lot more like the Web,
            since you're visiting pages with links on them instead of
            directories with files and subdirectories in them. It's a simple
            difference but it makes everything feel a bit more simple and modern
            as a result.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gemini also has something that Gopher does not: Markup. Well, kind
            of. Gemini uses a very, <em>very</em> simplified version of markdown
            called "gemtext". You only have a few structural tools to use:
            headings, unordered lists, blockquotes, and... well, that's about
            it. You're not given access to colors, bold, italic, or other
            formatted text. I think it's fine since this <em>is</em> supposed to
            be a plain text medium, but having semantic markers like headings is
            quite useful. Gemini clients don't have to render out headings in
            any special way, and can choose to leave the gemtext syntax visible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel like Gemini definitely is more user friendly than Gopher. I
            think it accomplishes what it sets out to do very well: when you
            visit a Gemini Capsule, it really feels like you're on someone's
            small, obscure, and cozy website. Gemini Capsules feel very human
            whereas Gopher feels like you're navigating one of those automated
            call systems. Don't get me wrong: Gopher is still very neat but if I
            had to recommend a protocol to my less nerdy friends I'd definitely
            pick Gemini.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can access my Gemini Capsule at
            <a href="gemini://text.mew151.net" data-gmi-footnote
              >gemini://text.mew151.net</a
            >. You will need a compatible Gemini client to view it.
