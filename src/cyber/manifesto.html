          <p>
            I've been exploring Neocities and the general Indie Web for some
            time now, and I've noticed a diversity of opinions about the current
            problems with the World Wide Web and what should be done about them.
            I've seen a lot of people's thoughts on things like nostalgia,
            accessiblity, corporations, javascript, and more. So I thought I'd
            write up the philosophies and technologies that my site are built
            upon.
          </p>
          <h2 id="websites-as-homes">Websites As Homes</h2>
          <p>
            I believe that websites are a wonderful form of personal expression.
            If you visit someone's actual living space, you can probably learn a
            lot about them just by looking around. Well, to me the ideal
            personal website feels like a lived-in space; a place you can wander
            around and get lost in. There's always going to be that one page
            that no one ever visits because it's an obscure index page or it's
            buried beneath multiple nested sections or something.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the real world, a home evolves over time. It fills up with new
            furniture. Walls may be painted new colors. New decorations go up
            and down with the seasons. Furniture breaks and needs to be
            replaced. You just accumulate more... STUFF over time. All of these
            things accumulate to make your home feel lived in by
            <em>you</em> and I think websites are very similar as well. As time
            goes on a website updates and adds pages and new areas to explore. I
            prefer visiting <em>lived-in</em> websites, and my goal is to
            hopefully build out this site more and more to make it feel more
            like my own every time I update it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am very disappointed by sterile, shallow websites. You know the
            ones that are just a single page linking to social media profiles or
            store pages, where the <em>real</em> content goes? These websites
            are not really homes and feel more like a billboard or highway sign
            intended to direct you somewhere else.
          </p>
          <p>
            I truly value websites that feel more like an explorable space. As
            such, I don't really prefer websites that are <em>only</em> blogs
            even when they are independently hosted. I mean, I think blogs have
            a place and are totally welcome as a feature of websites, but when a
            website is <em>only</em> a blog it doesn't really feel like a place
            to get lost in, it just feels like a one dimensional feed. I want to
            explore, and not just scroll. That being said, I'm not trying to say
            I hate blog websites, I just don't want my site to be only a blog. I
            tried that and didn't like it myself.
          </p>
          <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Fuck Google. Fuck Analytics. This website does not contain any
            client-side analytics, tracking, marketing, or other scripts
            designed to invade your privacy. Go ahead and check the source code,
            and you'll find I only use scripting for goofy effects, loading in
            feeds, and other things that respect your privacy. See the next
            section for my specific thoughts on JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of my hosts have basic server-side tools enabled which do track
            things like page visits and unique visitors. Neocities provides
            <a
              href="https://neocities.org/site/mew151/stats"
              title="praying my numbers aren't embarrassing here"
              data-gmi-drop-link
              >public access</a
            >
            to these site traffic stats if you'd like to see them. Both
            instances of these server-side analytics only record very basic data
            that your browser and network provide to the server while
            connecting: things like IP address and
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent"
              title="although modern user agent strings have completely evolved into madness due to selection pressure"
              data-gmi-drop-link
              >user agent string</a
            >. This kind of stuff is enabled on basically every website ever.
            This data is only used internally for those traffic charts, and will
            never be used to profile or target you in particular.
            <small
              >(I guess if you try to DoS attack this site then you'll probably
              be IP-banned which is technically targeting you in particular with
              this data but. Obviously that's a special circumstance.)</small
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            As of right now, this website does not use any cookies at all. If,
            for some reason, I ever add some goofy functionality that requires
            cookies, they will never be used to track you and will only be used
            for goofy functionality.
          </p>
          <h2 id="tech">My Stance On Web Technologies</h2>
          <p>
            Personally, I'm actually a fan of JavaScript as long as it isn't
            used in evil or particularly annoying ways. However, for my personal
            website I have a very specific technicality that I wish to avoid: I
            do not want to use any modern JavaScript frameworks. Things like
            <a
              href="https://reactjs.org/"
              title="Facebook's React"
              data-gmi-drop-link
              >React</a
            >
            or
            <a
              href="https://angular.io/"
              title="Google's Angular"
              data-gmi-drop-link
              >Angular</a
            >
            or even
            <a
              href="https://jquery.com/"
              title='"modern" framework'
              data-gmi-drop-link
              >jQuery</a
            >. I don't want to bundle together megabytes of other libraries just
            to get my pages to load. But sometimes I want to have fun buttons to
            click that do silly things. The <q>Classic Mode</q> button on my
            <a href="/about.html" title="I love classic mode" data-gmi-drop-link
              >About page</a
            >
            was such a fun addition to the page and made me realize how much I
            love random JavaScript like this every now and then.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also use JavaScript to automatically adjust and style certain
            parts of the website. Things like changing the
            <q>desktop background</q> of this site depending on the date and
            time of day, which was an idea I've wanted to put onto a website
            since I was a kid. The navigation menu is also built using
            JavaScript so whenever I add new navigation I can adjust it in one
            place instead of a million. You can read more about how I use
            scripting in my
            <a
              href="https://blog.mew151.net/entries/website-launch.html#scripting"
              title="Didn't I just say that I dislike blogs"
              data-gmi-footnote="Perfect Pop Star Academy: Musings on My Website Launch"
              >blog post about my site's launch.</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            While I use <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> throughout my
            website, I make sure that it is still perfectly usable without
            scripting (outside of things like quizzes and games which just can't
            exist without it obviously!). If you ever find a webpage that should
            work with scripts disabled but it doesn't, please
            <a
              href="/contact.html"
              title="seriously, don't be afraid to reach out"
              data-gmi-drop-link
              >contact me</a
            >
            and I'll fix it!
          </p>
          <p>
            In regards to HTML and CSS, I prefer to use their modern versions
            (HTML5 and CSS3). I know some people prefer to make retro-styled
            websites using retro-styled HTML, but I prefer to remake the old in
            more modern tech. For those who want to access my site on older,
            potentially <em>ancient</em> hardware, check out the version of my
            site hosted on the Gopher protocol. For those on modern machines
            that would still like a text-only experience, you can view a version
            hosted on the Gemini protocol. For more information, visit
            <a
              href="text"
              title="Hipster text protocols"
              data-gmi-footnote="Gemini/Gopher Page (you're already using one of them??)"
              >my page on those protocols.</a
            >
          </p>
          <h2 id="ai">On &ldquo;AI&rdquo; Usage (or lack thereof)</h2>
          <p>
            This site <strong>does not</strong> use any content generated from
            so-called <q>Generative AI</q>. This includes text, images, audio,
            <span
              title="Listen I was a professional web developer for many years. If I can't write basic static HTML without the need for an AI assistant, then that's just sad."
              >code,</span
            >
            or any other content. This is a personal website made for the
            purpose of expressing myself, so I want all of my words to be my
            own. There are plenty of other places to go if you want to see a
            computer's impression of human self-expression. If for some reason I
            do need to link to something AI-generated for illustrative purposes,
            I will clearly mark it with a disclaimer so you know it wasn't made
            by a person.
          </p>
          <h2 id="cringe">Cringe is Dead</h2>
          <p>
            The web is a place to be passionate. The world of slow and static
            websites is not typically filled with drama or bullies because
            things like algorithms and notifications do not typically exist, and
            <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention" data-gmi-drop-link
              >when they do exist</a
            >
            they are still uncommon, manual, and decentralized.
            <span
              title="The only reason you should be afraid of sharing your passions is because they are illegal and the government wants to [THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN REDACTED AS IT IS A KEY PART OF AN ONGOING U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATION]"
              >On this side of the world wide web, you should never be afraid to
              share what you're passionate about just because it's deemed as

          </p>
          <p>
            Cringe is dead. Be passionate and talk about whatever you want to on
