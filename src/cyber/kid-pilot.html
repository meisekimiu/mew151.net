            In late 1998, game development studio <strong>Dynamix</strong> put
            out a flight simulator game for children called
            <em>Kid Pilot.</em> This was likely an attempt to repackage the
            existing systems they built for their <em>Pro-Pilot</em> series of
            games for a younger audience. This game released to very little
            fanfare and has pretty much faded into obscurity, save for a
            <a

          <p>
            But... in early 2021 I managed to discover a previously undocumented
            easter egg in this game. When you try to look up this game now,
            aside from newer releases that happen to also be called
            <q>Kid Pilot</q>, you'll find some of the remnants of my easter egg
            hunt, including a

            coverage of this discovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've always wanted to conclude this search with a dedicated write
            up, since I'm unhappy with reddit posts and a Youtuber's basic
            summary of it. So... here it is! The true story of how I found a
            lost easter egg in a 20+ year old game!
          </p>
          <h2>How It Started (Totally Not A Creepypasta, I Swear)</h2>
          <p>
            When I was a young child around 5 years old, the
            <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr> my family used
            had a program that let customers redeem loyalty points for small
            rewards. My family ended up getting a bunch of CD-ROMs from this
            program, and among these was a copy of <em>Kid Pilot.</em> One day
            my father, a fan of planes and their software simulators, eagerly
            set up his joystick usually reserved for the more advanced grown-up
            types of plane games so that I could play <em>Kid Pilot.</em>
          </p>

            <figcaption>Kid Pilot (1998)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            It's hard to remember if I enjoyed it, but I'm sure I did. The
            colorful graphics and animated cartoon penguin
            <small>(Hah! It's because penguins can't fly! I get it!)</small>
            helper are standard fare for kid's educational games of the time.
            And at the very least, it was fun to play with the fancy joystick.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="kidpilot/Grin1.bmp"
              alt="A screen capture of the penguin from Kid Pilot smiling."

            />
            <figcaption>The cartoon penguin</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            But something happened that haunted me for years after the fact. I
            have a vivid memory of crashing the plane at one point and a message
            box popping up on the screen. This was before I could read, so I
            didn't know if the message box had any text on it. But I do remember
            seeing a "skull and crossbones" symbol made with the skull of the
            funny cartoon penguin mascot of the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            This <strong>terrified</strong> me. And this penguin skeleton became
            <em>the</em> boogeyman I'd be afraid of in the dark for years. Every
            night as I crept up the stairs to go to bed I would dread the idea
            of the <q>bird skeleton</q> standing up at the top of the staircase,
            staring down at me with its dark and empty eye sockets.
          </p>
          <h2>Return To Kid Pilot: Where's The Skeleton In The Closet?</h2>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, in early 2021 I was unemployed due to the whole COVID-19
            thing going on at the time. I already had plenty of free time on my
            hands due to my unemployment, and the pandemic had me feeling even
            more introspective than usual. Something I was fond of at the time
            was revisiting things that scared me when I was younger. It's
            empowering to come back as an adult and see something that used to
            terrify me and realize it's not scary at all anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            After knocking out a few of these past fears, I turned my eyes to
            that <q>bird skeleton</q> that haunted me going up the staircase
            every night. I had trouble even finding the name of the flight
            simulator at first, but I eventually found it was called
            <em>Kid Pilot</em> and started looking up any videos I could find to
            see how scary this game really was.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except... hm... none of the footage I could find on Youtube featured
            this skull graphic that terrified me as a kid. But this
            <em>is</em> a rather obscure game, so there were only a few short
            clips on Youtube available. I ended up downloading the game from
            <a
              href="https://archive.org/details/kid-pilot_202111"
              title="hoping the internet archive still exists whenever you are reading this"
              data-gmi-footnote="Kid Pilot (The Internet Archive)"
              >The Internet Archive</a
            >
            and getting it running on my
            <span title="I run arch btw">Linux computer</span> through Wine. I
            booted up the game, flew around the low-res city a bit and crashed
            into the ground. No popup. No skull. Nothing!
          </p>
          <figure>

              src="kidpilot/MB0000.bmp"
              alt="A screenshot from Kid Pilot. The plane has crashed but there's no popup on screen, just a cracked windshield and other damage to the UI."

            />
            <figcaption>No popup?!</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            This was really strange. I know memory can be a fickle thing,
            especially when it comes to childhood fears, but I have a vivid
            memory of being afraid of this skull graphic. I couldn't have
            imagined it, right?
          </p>
          <h2>Breaking Into The Game</h2>
          <p>
            As a fan of sites like
            <a
              href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/"
              title="ohhhh this is bringing in the nostalgia"
              >The Spriters Resource</a
            >
            and
            <a
              href="https://tcrf.net/The_Cutting_Room_Floor"
              title="I love this site so much"
              >The Cutting Room Floor,</a
            >
            I knew that if I really wanted to solve this mystery, I'd have to go
            into the game files to see if the spooky skull graphic is really
            there. But extracting assets from games can be tricky business
            depending on the game. Some games just dump all their assets right
            onto the CD in common formats. In those cases you just have to
            explore the files directly until you find the file you want. But
            other games are harder to crack, using special custom formats for
            their assets. Often many games bundle their assets together into
            larger files so that common textures can all be loaded together.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was hoping that <em>Kid Pilot</em> would be the former. While I
            have some experience in computer programming and game development, I
            don't really have the specific background to just start
            reverse-engineering a proprietary image format from an obscure
            children's flight simulator from 1998. I peered into
            <em>Kid Pilot's</em> files and found in the
            <code>Art/</code> directory... a bunch of proprietary asset pack
            files. Specifically, it seemed like all assets had a
            <code>.vol</code> extension and this looked like it was an in-house
            format made specifically by Dynamix.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="kidpilot/filelisting.png"
              alt="The `Art` directory in Kid Pilot's files: a directory named `Intro`, a directory named `TERRAIN`, and files named: `3DShapes.vol`, `Dml.vol`, `Dml-low.vol`, `Palettes.vol`, `Panel.vol`, `Wx.vol`"
              title="Ugh... why did these devs have to be efficient and load things together instead of just slam all their files raw on the disc?"
            />
            <figcaption>The <code>Art/</code> directory</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            This was going to be a major obstacle towards getting a look at the
            assets. I did not think I was going to crack this format. On more
            famous games that use these proprietary formats, people eventually
            find out how to extract the assets and document this online but
            we're talking about an obscure educational game that the internet
            almost forgot... <em>although...</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            While <em>Kid Pilot</em> is an obscurity, Dynamix <em>did</em> make
            other games. Perhaps they reused this <code>.vol</code> package
            format between games and someone <em>had</em> documented this file
            format after all for another one of their games. And so I went
            through Dynamix's portfolio looking to see if anyone had resources
            on this file format after all.
          </p>
          <p>
            And well... I have to hand it to

              >The <em>Outpost 2: Divided Destiny</em> Fan Community.</a
            >
            It turns out that in between making flight simulators, Dynamix also
            made a real-time strategy series. And one that was popular enough to
            maintain a fan community up into the present day. This community has
            done a lot to keep the <em>Outpost</em> games alive with unofficial
            patches to the game and more importantly...
            <em>modding tools!</em> Tools that can insert new assets into the
            game... tools that happen to be able to read and write from
            <code>.vol</code> files!

            and I pointed it towards one of the <code>.vol</code> archives
            present in <em>Kid Pilot.</em> And it worked! A bunch of
            <kbd>.BMP</kbd> files flooded onto my computer straight out of the
            game. And as I scrolled through dozens and dozens of monochrome
            textures used for skyscrapers... I found a file called
            <code>IsThis.Bmp</code>

              <code style="font-style: normal">IsThis.Bmp</code><br />Huh... It
              <em>is</em> kind of creepy!
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h2>Where Is This In The Game?</h2>
          <p>
            While it was a relief to know that I didn't manufacture that memory
            of a creepy skull of a cartoon penguin in this game... this asset
            raised more questions. I don't remember anything about cards in the
            game. Initially I thought maybe there was some kind of extra
            <q>playing card</q> mode in the game where you had to fly around and
            collect cards and the <q>Is This Your Card</q> message would pop up
            but... no dice! Or cards, I guess.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did find a matching texture among the other assets I extracted,
            named <kbd>FullDeck.Bmp</kbd>. It's a full texture sheet of playing
            cards and presumably a card would be clipped from this texture and
            placed into the <q>Is This Your Card</q> blank spot.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="kidpilot/FullDeck.Bmp"
              alt="A texture from Kid Pilot. It contains all 52 basic playing cards in a grid."
              title="I think this is a yakuman"
            />
            <figcaption>
              <kbd style="font-style: normal">FullDeck.Bmp</kbd>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            I needed to figure out what could possibly trigger these textures to
            appear. And so I began to get technical! I first snooped around the
            <kbd>KidPilot.exe</kbd> file in a hex editor and was able to confirm
            references in the binary to the <kbd>IsThis.Bmp</kbd> and
            <kbd>FullDeck.Bmp</kbd> files. Near them were some other readable
            strings, namely <kbd>Card</kbd>, <kbd>Suit</kbd>, <kbd>penn</kbd>,
            and <kbd>PennAndTeller</kbd>. Hm...
          </p>
          <p>
            I then decided to take it one step further. I ran
            <kbd>KidPilot.exe</kbd> through a decompiler to investigate what the
            code is doing with all of these weird strings. The code seems to
            roughly go a bit like this.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When the player crashes their plane, do the following:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Call some mysterious Windows API functions with the strings
                  <kbd>PennAndTeller</kbd>, <kbd>penn</kbd>, <kbd>Card</kbd>,
                  and <kbd>Suit</kbd>. If these functions return values,
                  continue to the next step, otherwise stop.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Read <kbd>Card</kbd> and <kbd>Suit</kbd> values, and use them

          </ul>
          <p>
            Now what could this mysterious Windows API function be? It's a
            <a
              href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getprivateprofilestring"
              title="This is the most I know about Windows Programming."
              data-gmi-footnote="GetPrivateProfileString function (winbase.h)"
              >function to read an INI config file!</a
            >
            So I shoved some lines of text into Kid Pilot's
            <code>KidPilot.ini</code> config file to see if it would work.
          </p>
          <code class="multiline">
            [PennAndTeller]<br />
            penn=1<br />
            Suit=Diamonds<br />
            Card=King<br />
          </code>
          <p>
            I ran the game and eagerly crashed my plane into the ground to see
            if it would work and...
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="kidpilot/MB0002.bmp"
              alt='A screenshot of Kid Pilot. The player has crashed their plane and there is a dialog box on the screen that is the "Is This Your Card?" graphic from earlier, with a King of Diamonds placed in the empty area.'

            />
            <figcaption>It appeared! I got it to work!!!</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            And so <em>finally</em> I was able to recreate the experience I
            remembered as a kid: Crashing the plane and have a spooky skull
            appear on screen. I was finally done, and it turns out I just saw a
            weird card trick easter egg this whole time? Huh... actually...
            <em>wait a moment...</em>
          </p>
          <h2>A New Mystery: How Did I See This As A Kid?!</h2>
          <p>
            The <em>only</em> way someone can possibly see this in game is if
            they happen to edit the <code>KidPilot.ini</code> configuration
            file. Thanks to the decompiler I know that the only code path that
            displays the <q>Is This Your Card?</q> graphic needs these specific
            INI flags to be set. How could I have possibly triggered this as a
            kid who <em>wasn't even able to read yet?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I ended up coming up with 3 theories for what could have happened,
            but they all seemed pretty unlikely.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b
                >There's a bigger playing card mode hidden in the game that is
                so well-obfuscated that it was able to hide from my
                decompilation efforts.</b
              >
              <p>
                This theory fell apart pretty quickly. If there really was a
                mode like that still hidden in the game, why wouldn't the code I
                found also be obfuscated? Plus the code I did find seemed small
                in scope, like it was quickly hardcoded in and not part of a
                bigger game mode.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b
                >This was snuck in by a developer (and perhaps aspiring
                magician) as a prank. Early cheat code/easter egg sites listed
                it online and my father decided to try it out.</b
              >
              <p>
                While I was not computer literate (or literate in general) when
                I played this, my father was the one who installed it and he
                <em>is</em> pretty computer literate. He totally seems like the
                kind of person who'd look up cheat codes and try them out on any
                new games. The problem is <em>Kid Pilot's</em> obscurity. As far
                as I can tell, up until I started looking into this in 2021,
                <strong>no one</strong> has <strong>ever</strong> documented
                this easter egg on the internet. So this theory was a quick dead
                end.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b
                >There was some other game or software, presumably made by the
                same developer or publisher and/or possibly related to Penn &
                Teller, that interacted with Kid Pilot in a weird forgotten
                ARG-style puzzle between multiple games.</b
              >
              <p>
                This was my personal favorite theory. The hypothetical idea here
                is that you'd pick a card in one game and that game would scan
                your computer to see if it has <em>Kid Pilot</em> installed. If
                it's installed, it writes the card you picked into
                <em>Kid Pilot's</em> config file to give you quite a surprise.
              </p>
              <p>
                I dug around a few games that seemed like good leads. In
                particular,
                <a
                  href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/29126/sabrina-the-teenage-witch-spellbound/"
                  title="you don't know how badly I wanted this to be the answer to this mystery it would have been SO COOL"
                  ><em>Sabrina: The Teenage Witch - Spellbound</em></a
                >
                seemed like an excellent lead. It at least had the same
                publisher as <em>Kid Pilot</em>, it came out a year after, it is
                a game all about magic, and it
                <em>even features Penn Jilette of Penn &amp; Teller fame...</em>
                but it did not contain any functionality related to
                <em>Kid Pilot.</em>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>At this point all my theories were complete dead ends.</p>
          <h2>An Anticlimactic End?</h2>
          <p>
            At some point while bashing my head against this mystery for some
            time, I ended up triggering an error while playing
            <em>Kid Pilot</em> and what I saw shocked me.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="kidpilot/error.png"
              alt="An error message popup in Kid Pilot. It features the same skull found in the earlier card dialog."
              title="is THIS your card?! (throws an exception)"
            />
            <figcaption>Hey! It's our spooky friend again!</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Yeah so turns out the skull graphic is used in more than one place.
            Slowly it dawned on me that what I saw as a kid was probably not the
            <q>Is This Your Card</q> dialog but instead this error dialog.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm glad the mystery's been fully solved now, but darn it I wanted
            Theory #3 to be true so badly! Still, I think it's kind of
            incredible what actually happened here:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              An error message pops up when I play this game as a toddler,
              mildly traumatizing me as a result
            </li>
            <li>
              Twenty years later, I decide to revisit this game that scared me
              as a kid. But I don't see the error message this time.
            </li>
            <li>
              In desperation, I break into the game and find assets for a
              completely unrelated, undocumented easter egg that just
              coincidentally happens to use the same graphic that I saw as a kid
            </li>
            <li>
              In further desperation, I become the first person besides the
              developers to figure out how to trigger this easter egg
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Speaking of the developers, I ended up reaching out to the lead
            programmer on the project on LinkedIn. Here's what he had to say:
          </p>
          <blockquote
            style="
              border: 1px solid #ffffff55;
              padding: 1em;
              font-size: 1.1rem;
              font-family: 'Arial', 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
            "
          >
            <p>
              Oh man, that's been a long time. So the idea was you would do a
              "card force" (do a card deck shuffle, but your friend will always
              pick the card you want them to) of the 3 of clubs.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Then, at some future point you roughly land (i.e. crash) your
              plane in Las Vegas (where Penn and Teller perform) and the game
              will pop up a dialog saying "Is this your card?" showing the 3 of
              clubs. Thereby freaking out your friend. "How did you do that?".
              Hope that helps
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              So mystery solved: I am a Penn and Teller fan. I put that in,
              purely for fun. If you crash in Vegas, that dialog will pop up. If
              you don't set the specific rank & suit, it will display the 3 of
              clubs. I reached out to P & T's people for an endorsement (like
              including their logo), but they declined. So we put in the dead
              penguin.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <div style="text-align: center">
            <em
              >Note: From my testing, you do not need to be in Vegas to see this
              easter egg!</em
            >
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            So that pretty much confirms that's all there is to the easter egg.
            Chasing this thing was a pretty wild ride!

          <h2>Epilogue (And More Uncharted Territory)</h2>
          <p>
            It's weird to know that I managed to actually discover an easter egg
            in a game like this. While I'm pretty sure there are plenty of
            easter eggs in games that I've been able to find on my own before, I
            don't think I've ever been <em>the first person in the world</em> to
            actually discover a specific one.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do a web search for <em>Kid Pilot</em>, these days you should
            be able to find remnants of my original search where I asked for
            help solving the mystery (even though I ended up solving it myself).
            I asked about on Reddit back in the day, and I also even reached out
            for help to the Youtuber oddheader, who ended up featuring my
            discovery in one of his videos.
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center">
            <iframe
              width="560"

            One thing I mentioned to oddheader at the time that I never shared
            publicly up until now is that during my search I found evidence of
            further easter eggs in <em>Kid Pilot</em>
            <small
              >(I hoped that maybe I could tempt oddheader and his subscribers
              to help me solve my mystery if there was a chance that
              <em>they</em> could make history and discover an easter egg in the
              game too)</small
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yeah that's right...
            <b
              >there are potentially more undocumented easter eggs to be found
              in the game!</b
            >
            I was mainly motivated to solve the <q>Is This Your Card?</q> easter
            egg because if I didn't I'd feel like I was going crazy. The main
            mystery has been solved and so I don't feel too much motivation at
            the moment to try and dig any more. And so... I'll leave some clues
            here and perhaps <em>you</em> can be the next person to make
            <em>an historic</em> discovery about this obscure game!
          </p>
          <p>
            <u
              >There appear to be images of some developers' kids hidden in the
              game!</u
            >
            I found various pictures of kids among the game's textures. One of
            them is even called <code>glenkids.bmp</code> (with the "glen" most
            likely referring to lead programmer Glen Wolfram). There also seems
            to be a graduation photo and a photo of a child named Julia in there
            as well. I won't upload/post them here for privacy reasons, but if
            you follow my footsteps you should be able to find them yourself!
          </p>
          <p>
            What I find interesting is that these textures are packed with the
            textures that are used for level geometry. They could be just dummy
            files included in the archive just because there was available space
            or placeholder images used early in development... but there's a
            chance they <em>could</em> actually be used in the game, hidden away
            in some obscure part of the level geometry.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's the fun of discovering a new mystery in an old and obscure
            game. There's currently no proof that these images
            <em>aren't</em> used in the game. So are <em>you</em> ready to
            explore PC obscurity to find out? The world's waiting!

            Thanks for reading this write up on <em>Kid Pilot!</em> I'm glad I
            can finally tell this story on my site! I often wonder what it's
            like to be the people behind media for children, getting reached out
            to decades later by the people who grew up with your work. Perhaps
            I'll find out in a few decades.
