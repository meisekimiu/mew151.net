      <h3>Roles and Development</h3>
      <p>
        This game was a <strong>solo project</strong> made in a Game Jam
        environment. Specifically, it was made for Nicole He&rsquo;s
        <q>Vacation</q> Stream in July of 2021. The game was made in a week,
        although it has been updated several times to add in new vacation
        memories and scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        Virtual Vacation Zone begins on an initial <q>web site</q> that was
        built in React. The rest of the game was built in the same custom
        Pixi.js-based game engine used in
        <a href="tax.html">Extreme Tax Masters.</a> The visual novel segment of
        the game was scripted in Ink and uses a newer version of the visual
        novel system used in Extreme Tax Masters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The graphics for the visual novel segment, as well as the music,
        writing, and engineering were all completed single-handedly.
