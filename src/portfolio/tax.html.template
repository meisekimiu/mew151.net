      <h3>Roles and Development</h3>
      <p>
        This game was a <strong>solo project</strong> made in a Game Jam
        environment. Specifically, it was made in a week for Nicole He&rsquo;s
        <q>Extreme</q> Stream in March of 2021.
      </p>

      <p>
        Extreme Tax Masters was made in a custom TypeScript-based engine that
        uses <strong>Pixi.js</strong> as its renderer. The narrative script was
        written in <strong>Ink</strong>
        and is interpreted by the game to display the visual novel portions. As
        Ink was built to be extensible, custom commands were implemented to do
        things like load and display sprites as well as change game states.
      </p>

      <p>
        The design of the game engine was based on things learned from building
        the game engine for
        <a
          href="czp.html"
          title="For legal reasons I couldn&rsquo;t re-use the same engine obviously; {{
            COMPANY_FULLNAME
          }} technically owns that game engine!"
          >{{ ABBR }} Racer.</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Originally, the game was intended to rank a player&rsquo;s performance
        during the Tax Gameplay segments, with the intention they could rely on
        either their social links or their pure tax skills to deal with the
        game&rsquo;s final scenario. Ultimately, this idea was dropped as
        accessibility was a concern—it would be unfair to punish a player if
        they had issues with smashing their keyboard or didn&rsquo;t have an
        external keyboard. This idea was also dropped due to ludonarrative
        reasons: the game is <em>supposed</em> to be positive and uplifting, but
        the idea of being a <q>tax master</q> in the narrative while receiving
        failing grades in the gameplay didn&rsquo;t mesh well with the
        game&rsquo;s intentions.
