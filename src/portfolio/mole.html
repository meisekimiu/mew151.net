      <p>
        Hymn of the Moles is a rhythm game based on The Residents' 1981 album,
        <q>Mark of the Mole,</q> and the unfinished Atari game that was supposed
        to be based on it. You play as a <q>Mole,</q> hired to work in the
        mines. While working, you sing songs and this creates the main gameplay:
        hit the arrow keys in time with the various notes on screen and the
        beat.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can download the game <a href="download/moles.zip">here.</a> This is
        a Windows EXE, but I have tested it with Wine on my Linux computer and
        it works fine!

      <h3>Roles and Development</h3>
      <p>
        This game was a <strong>solo project,</strong> made during the 29th
        Ludum Dare game jam. The theme for this jam was
        <q>Beneath the Surface.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        The game was written in C++ with OpenGL, SDL2, and FMOD. A lot of the
        library code was written ahead of time. An interesting fact about the
        engine code I'm using here: it was written before I had taken Linear
        Algebra and so a lot of the code doing transformations like
        scaling/rotation are doing them <q>manually,</q> rather than using
        matrices to perform linear transformations. In hindsight, it would have
        been much easier to just use matrix multiplication... but I didn't know
        better at the time.
      </p>
      <p>The game uses music and characters by The Residents.</p>
