      <h3>Roles and Development</h3>
      <p>
        This game was a <strong>solo project.</strong> This game was made in an
        environment similar to a <strong>Game Jam.</strong> Specifically it was
        made for Nicole He's Vacation Stream from July of 2021. The game was
        made in about a week, although it has been updated several times after
        the stream to add in the new vacation memories and scenarios as the
        world opened back up for travel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The initial "web site" the game starts on is built in React, which then
        transitions over to the rest of the game which is built in the same
        custom Pixi.js-based game engine I used in
        <a href="tax.html">Extreme Tax Masters.</a> This visual novel segment of
        the game is scripted in Ink and uses a newer version of the visual novel
        system also used in Extreme Tax Masters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The graphics for the visual novel segment, as well as the music and
        writing for the rest of the game, were also done by me in addition to
        all of the engineering work.
