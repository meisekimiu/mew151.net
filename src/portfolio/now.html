          as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> focused on Front End
          Development. The web application allows user to upload and manage
          files and it includes a file processing pipeline to extract meaningful
          metadata and convert to compatible archival and presentational
          formats. A lot of the work I do is open source and you can see it on

          In my free time, I am working on a game engine in C++. You can see a
          simple demo game I've made with it

          I want to continue fleshing out this engine to make more and more
          complex games. Right now I want to design a data-driven system that
          allows a developer to define and instantiate "prefab" objects.
