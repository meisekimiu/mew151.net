    <h1>KALW - The Residents Go to the Dogs</h1>
    <p>
      This is a recording of KALW's &quot;The Residents Go to the Dogs&quot;
      program from
      <time datetime="2017-08-06 20:00:00-08:00">August 6th, 2017</time>.
      <span
        title="Seriously. I did a bit-by-bit copy of the stream and it was so compressed that 2.5 hours of recording was only 68 Megabytes..."
        >This is essentially a perfect copy of the stream from the
        website,</span
      >
      although it may have been slightly further compressed when I cut it down
      and exported it in my audio editor. All the music tracks are intact,
      however, the quality is not ideal (You can find better audio quality from
      those unauthorized Youtube uploads) so if you've come to pirate Rz or
      Moondog music for some reason... well, this isn't exactly the best place
      to do so. Anyway, if you are an angry Sarah Cahill or Cryptic Corporation
      representative, I can take down this recording. I can also cut out the
      music bits if that's what bothers you, since really the only interesting
      thing for Residents fans are the talking sections. Although if you do
      contact me, please tell me the titles of these Moondog tracks, because I'm
      not familiar with all of them.
