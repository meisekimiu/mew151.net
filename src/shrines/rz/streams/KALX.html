    <h1>
      KALX: <br />
      The Worst Residents Interview Ever
    </h1>
    <p class="explanation">
      <strong>2023 Foreword:</strong><br />
      When I wrote the description on this page back in 2018, I was still very
      emotional from the announcement of Hardy Fox's death. I dubbed this
      <q>the worst Residents interview ever</q> at the time, though I doubt it
      really is the worst.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Update:</strong>
      Okay I listened to it and it's actually the worst residents interview
      ever. Carry on.
    </p>
    <p>Alright, listen here you little shit.</p>
    <p>
      Yeah, I'm talking to you, "DJ Deep Mission", if that IS your real name.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a recording of KALX's short interview with Homer Flynn from
      <time datetime="2018-10-30 19:00:00-08:00">October 30th, 2018</time>. This
      is a perfect copy of the stream from their website, which was already
      compressed when it was broadcast. <strong>FUN FACT:</strong> This is
      actually the <em>worst</em> Residents interview ever. It's actually kind
      of impressive. I mean... there are a lot of shitty Residents interviews.
      But it takes a LOT to make me hit my desk in rage. I mean, holy FUCK. I
      got multiple bingoes on my "Horrible Residents Interview" bingo sheet.
      Jesus christ. So congratulations Mr. Deep Mission. Perhaps it's because
      I'm still mourning the loss of Hardy Fox which was announced TODAY so I'm
      reacting even more strongly to this than normal, but still... you win the
      honor of doing the worst Residents interview ever in the history of
      humanity.
