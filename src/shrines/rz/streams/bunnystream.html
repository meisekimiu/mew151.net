    <h1>The Bunny Boy Streaming Event @ Bourges, France</h1>
    <p>
      On April 20th, 2019, Bandits-Mages hosted a live streamed performance
      event for their Residents exhibition with a very special guest:
      Roger/Bunny from the Bunny Boy! In this event, Bunny reopened his e-mail
      inbox at the old <u>wearedoomed666@gmail.com</u> address and responded to
      e-mails live. He also talks about witches, how life has been in the last
      10 years, witches, his relationship with Randy Rose, and also witches.
      Most of what ended up being streamed was in this recording and so the
      framerate and quality are pretty much identical to the quality of the
      Twitch stream. This recording ends pretty abruptly, but that's only
      because the stream did. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not but
      the stream didn't go back up afterwards. Also due to technical issues and
      miscommunications, the first few minutes of the stream aren't captured in
      this recording... but it's just like Bunny sleeping for the first 30
      minutes so nothing of value is missing at all.

      Oh, also Bunny wakes up at around the

      One final thing: Just to be clear the "Homer" that's very visible on the
      screen for most of the computer shots is just one of Bunny's contacts.
      Bunny would never steal Homer Flynn's computer.
