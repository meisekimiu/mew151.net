      <h1>Archived Streams</h1>
      <p>
        I've archived a few random Residents streams over the years, mainly from
        the mid-late 2010's.

          A program that ran on KALW on August 6th, 2017. Features interview
          with Homer Flynn about The Residents and one of their inspirations:
          Moondog.

          Running on KALX on October 30, 2018, very soon after the announcement
          of Hardy Fox's death. Emotional from that, I dubbed this
          <q>the worst Residents interview ever</q> at the time, though I doubt
          it really is the worst.

          On April 20th, 2019, Bandits-Mages hosted a live streamed performance
          event for their Residents exhibition with a very special guest:
          Roger/Bunny from the Bunny Boy! Watch him sleep for 30 minutes and
          read emails for another hour and a half.
