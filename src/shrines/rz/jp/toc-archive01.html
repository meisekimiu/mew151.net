      <h2>The Residents in Japan: Intro</h2>
      <p class="crosspost">
        The following text is an archived version of my original forum posts
        about The Residents in Japan. I've done more research since making those
        posts, so I'll try to add additional context if I get something horribly
        wrong.

        The Residents are really only "popular" among the English speaking
        world. Although not all albums require knowing English to enjoy them, a
        lot of the "smarter" stuff they do is in English and typically some sort
        of commentary on Western and American culture. But somehow The Residents
        managed to find a following in Japan. Wave Records initially handled the
        Japanese releases of Residents albums, although I'm not entirely sure
        how that relationship started. The Residents' popularity in Japan spiked
        after the release of The Big Bubble, which was hugely successful in
        Japan, to the point that Wave Records actually got The Residents to
        perform live in Japan, kicking off their 13th Anniversary Tour. After
        this, The Residents' popularity definitely fell in Japan, whether it was
        because the Mole Trilogy was never developed further, interest in "New
        Wave" music started to fall by then, or of financial problems with Wave
        Records.
      </p>

      <p>
        This basically means that most albums prior to the 13th Anniversary Tour
        were officially released in Japan. Afterwards, The Residents relevance
        in Japan faded, although with the internet it is much easier to import
        or digitally buy the music so a Japanese record label taking care of
        things seems redundant. I have found a Japanese label now printing
        Residents CDs called "Bomba (ボンバ) Records", though. And another one
        called "Bird Song". It's pretty hard to keep track of who is releasing
        what these days. It's also difficult to find which albums were
        originally released in Japan by Wave, mainly because Wave does not seem
        to exist any more. And the information that's around doesn't really
        mention The Residents at all, although the official Rz website confirms
        that Wave released The Big Bubble in Japan (with a lyrics sheet! If
        anyone has this Japanese version of The Big Bubble, please share a scan
        of this supposed sheet!). Another interesting thing the Rz website
        mentions about Wave is that they "even had a Residents sculpture
        installed in the lobby of their Tokyo record store." I have found no
        other information on this sculpture at all on the internet, but it's
        probably the thing about Wave that intrigues me the most. Does this
        sculpture still exist somewhere? Where is it? Are there any photographs
        of it at all?
      </p>

      <p>
        The 13th Anniversary Shows were mainly played in the now closed PARCO
        Theater (formerly known as Seibu Theater) in Shibuya, although the Rz
        website mentions one show in Kyoto with no information on where this
        show was played. Shibuya's PARCO Theater hosted other interesting acts,
        such as The Ramones and apparently even a performance of The Rocky
        Horror Show, among more traditional Japanese music acts and plays.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, despite being world-famous rock stars, The Residents don't have
        that strong of a following in Japan anymore. Sure, they definitely have
        fans all across the world and Japan is no exception, but most likely
        there is no J. Edgar Sakimoto in Tokyo about to spend one hundred
        thousand quankeroonies trying to get a Ultimate Box Set.

        >As we'll see later... The Residents were popular enough to warrant a
        bunch of shows at the Blue Note in Tokyo. After much more research it's
        clear that what I mention about their popularity falling in Japan after
        the 13th Anniversary is inaccurate.</ins

        What are The Residents called in Japan? The Residents are simply
        called... "The Residents" in Japan. Why would they be called anything
        else? :)
      </p>

      <p>
        But in Japanese, their name is written out as 「ザ・レジデンツ」 ("Za
        Rejidentsu") or more commonly just 「レジデンツ」 ("Rejidentsu").
        Generally the "The" in their name is dropped except when put on albums
        and such. Even the Japanese Wikipedia article drops the "the" and simply
        calls them

        I don't think we English-speaking people have a real name for the
        eyeballs. I personally go for "The Eyeball-Headed Residents" when
        talking about the guys in the eyeball masks, but that's a mouthful! One
        thing I've noticed when browsing Japanese websites about The Residents
        is that they actually have a specific name they call the eyeball guys!
        I've seen people just mention "the eyeballs", but I've seen many people
        refer to the eyeball-headed residents (...that'll catch on eventually!)
        as 「<ruby>目玉<rp>(</rp><rt>めだま</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby
        ><ruby>親父<rp>(</rp><rt>おやじ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>」or 「<ruby
          >目玉<rp>(</rp><rt>めだま</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby
        >おやじ」 ("Medama Oyaji"). If you stick that into Google translate,
        you'll see that it literally translates to "Eyeball Father", which is
        kind of weird.
        <span title="contrary to what my fanfictions might say"
          >I wouldn't consider any of The Residents my father...</span
        >
        what's going on?!

      <p>
        Well, Medama Oyaji is actually the name of a character from a very
        popular long-running manga/anime series called "GeGeGe no Kitaro"!
        Apparently an official localization named him as "Daddy Eyeball", which
        kind of makes more sense than "Eyeball Father". The franchise is so
        popular that when Japanese people see The Residents, they immediately
        think, "Oh! It's just like Medama Oyaji!"
