        The following text is an archived version of my original forum posts
        about The Residents in Japan. I've done more research since making those
        posts, so I'll try to add additional context if I get something horribly
        wrong.

          embarrassing to say it on a Residents forum of all places. I'm also
          hoping one of my favorite Japanese performers of actual weird (well,
          compared to normal pop) music, Mishio Ogawa, live as well during the
          trip. And yet one thing I always thought would be cool to do in Japan
          is actually watch a western music group perform live! I mean,
          obviously I'm interested in Japanese perspectives of western media, so
          that just sounds amazing right?</small

        Tuxedos, Top hats, and Eyeball Masks are their trademarks. The
        Residents, for the first time in 32 years since 1985, have decided to
        visit Japan for a live performance. They formed in around 1966 in the
        American state of Louisiana and debuted in 1974 with their debut album
        "Meet The Residents". "Eskimo" and "The Commercial Album" were captured
        in the performance of "The Eyeball Show", and they were the first of
        their many much-discussed works and controversial expressions. Though
        they always take masked forms during their live performances, their
        sound and visual art have continued to have a big influence on music
        scenes from rock to avant-garde and many artists. In 2017, there are
        plans to announce a new work, and also to continue activities without
        revealing their identities as the "We have no sex, face, or personality"
        Residents. I want to feel their unique worldly feelings of their live
        performances.

        Here is a translated blurb from the "Medama no Gakkou" (School of
        Eyeballs) event happening in Japan about a month before the shows:
      </p>

      <blockquote class="translation">
        Formed in the late 60's, the mysterious American music group "The
        Residents" who have stared at the world with those big eyeballs are
        miraculously coming to Japan for the first time in 32 years! They will
        be holding the world premier performance of their new show "In Between
        Dreams" at Blue Note Tokyo in March. To commemorate this, music critic
        Manabu Yuasa, who was the editor of the Resident's biographical book
        "The Eyeball That Sees The Dancing Eyeball*" and who calls them "The
        most famous enigma in the world of American music", is offering a course
        on them titled "School of Eyeballs"-- A one night lesson with
        fundamental knowledge about The Residents, a screening of footage about
        their current activities, and a trial listening of a sound generator all
        joined together with commentary!

        On an unrelated note, I love that the eyeballs are being used as the
        dakuten in the logo (The two dots/dashes that should be in the
        <span style="font-size: 2em">だ</span> in めだま are replaced with the
        eyeballs). That's a pretty common thing to see in Japanese logos and
        stuff, but to see it done with the Residents eyeballs is pretty darn
        amazing. The の with a top hat is pretty great as well.

        I was going to post something regarding Japanese comments on Rz videos
        hosted online... but I actually have some news to deliver instead!
      </p>

      <p>
        A new event is happening on Monday, March 6th in Japan! The web
        broadcasting platform
        <a href="http://www.dommune.com/about/en/">DOMMUNE</a> will be
        broadcasting a program to commemorate The Residents' first appearance in
        Japan in over 30 years later in March. The program will feature talks on
        The Residents from various experts, inluding Manabu Yuasa, who led the
        "Medama no Gakkou" event that happened a few weeks ago. There will also
        be Rz music played later in the program. So basically it sounds a lot
        like that whole "Medama no Gakkou" event. The music segments are even
        called "learning" segments, like you're taking a class at the school of
        eyeballs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The great thing about this event, though, is that you'll be able to
        watch it live! It'll be broadcast live on March 6th, from 21:00~25:00
        JST. Or about
        <strong>4:00 am to 8:00 am pacific time on March 6th.</strong> You can
        view it live either from
        <a href="http://www.dommune.com/">their website</a> or as a live stream
        on
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC06WalpLcwTx-0ZVgglMc5Q"
          >their Youtube channel.</a
        >
        However, you <strong>cannot</strong> rewatch any old streams, you can
        only tune in live to watch it. The DOMMUNE website has this interesting
        quote, though:
        <em
          >"DOMMUNE is only possible because of the help of all the performers,
          the artists who make the music played, and many other people. You can
          record the DOMMUNE stream for your own personal enjoyment, but please
          do not post it online or make it available for download. We ask that
          you respect this policy so that everybody can enjoy DOMMUNE!"</em
        >
        If you can tune in, maybe look into recording it... just for archiving
        purposes, of course!
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, one other thing about this event is that people can actually go
        to the studio they record from and be part of the "studio audience"! And
        I will be there! Yay!
      </p>

      <p>
        So, how about that whole DOMMUNE broadcast, right? I don't think anyone
        recorded it... but it was pretty awesome! I was there for the first half
        of the program before I had to bail out so I could make it back to where
        I was staying before the trains stopped, but being there was well worth
        the 20 minute walk from the station in the cold! A funny thing about the
        studio was that while we were walking there, we got lost and walked by
        this group of about 20 people gathered around a building in the general
        area where the studio was supposed to be... we walked past, thinking
        that there was no way that group was there for The Residents thing...
        only to find out after swearing at Google Maps a few times that it was
        indeed the building! Not all of them were actually there for the event,
        as there was something going on before it, but it was still surprising
        to see all the people who were interested in The Residents.
      </p>

      <p>
        And yeah, the whole program was basically just an overview of the
        history of The Residents. It was still pretty cool, and I even saw a
        poster for The Eyeball Show I had never seen before! And I got to talk
        to a Japanese Rz fan in the audience! Coolio!
      </p>

      <p>
        Also I went to a Tower Records in Shibuya (yes, those still exist in
        Japan) later in the week and picked up some cool stuff. I picked up an
        interesting Japanese remix album titled "Attack of the Killer Black
        Eyeball" by <strong>XXX RESIDENTS.</strong> Yeah, a Japanese Residents
        Remix album! And even more interesting is the fact that this XXX
        RESIDENTS group was created by (or at least with heavy involvement with)
        Naohiro Ukawa... who also created the DOMMUNE clube and streaming
        studio. I wonder if that DOMMUNE event was Blue Note Tokyo's idea or
        just his idea...
      </p>

      <p>
        I have to say that "Attack of the Killer Black Eyeball" was pretty
        interesting, but... well, it wasn't the best album I've ever heard,
        let's just put it that way.. I appreciated "Harsh Noise For Hotel Missy
        Kyoto" the most... you can probably find that one on youtube or
        somewhere if you'd like to listen to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, Tower Records also had actual Residents albums! Quite a few,
        too. They had WB:RMX, The Third Reich 'n Roll, Demons Dance Alone, Mark
        of the Mole, Not Available, Animal Lover, Icky Flix, The King and Eye
        RMX, The Big Bubble, Intermission, and I think a few other ones too. I
        remember they had one album in particular on the shelf that completely
        surprised me... but... that's a story for another time.

      <p>
        This thread's topic title. YES. It's happening right now. The Residents
        ARE in Japan! Man... when I created this thread I had a few topics I
        selected to cover and expected only a slow flow of small updates after
        that... I didn't expect to be talking about actual NEWS, and certainly
        not breaking news on... well, just see!
      </p>

      <p>
        So, the first of the <strong>In Between Dreams</strong> shows happened
        yesterday... or today... or whatever. Now unfortunately, no setlist or
        really any live reports have come out. So sorry about the lack of any
        information there. Will post more info as it comes available. There has
        been a bit of info put out about the shows though. First off, Blue Note
        Tokyo will be serving a special drink during these shows called
        <strong>TYRONE'S OBSCURITY,</strong> which contains Pastis and lychees
        (which look kind of like eyeballs...). I'd love to try an official
        Residents drink! Anyway, Blue Note has also talked about at least some
        of the official goods, including classic eyeball shirts (of course!) and
        <strong>The Ghost of Hope</strong> in both vinyl and CD forms! I think
        some people have gotten the album a bit early and have been a bit quiet
        about it... but Blue Note has specifically stated on their website that
        the album would available at these shows prior to official release.
      </p>

      <!-- Uncomment once we find this pic again:
        <p>Anyway, I hear that Hein Fokker instagrammed <a href="https://scontent.fdtw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17425050_1387022101361250_4191639988559533186_n.jpg?oh=05a8881a554950bfb3f2b7deb8043caa&oe=592605FF">this staff access badge</a> from the show out. And it's pretty awesome! It's interesting to see the show being called by an actual Japanese name, 夢の中で ("Yume no naka de"), which could be translated as... well, "In Between Dreams". The text on the bottom just literally says "All Access".</p>
      -->

      <p>
        One last bit of news is that Blue Note has put out
        <a href="http://www.bluenote.co.jp/jp/news/features/8011/"
          >an interview with The Residents...</a
        >
        and, well if you've followed this thread before, then you know it means
        it's TRANSLATION TIME. I knew this interview was going to be great when
        I saw this quote from it: 「トランプは"The Ghost of Nope"」... That got
        my attention... and as you read my horrible translation, you'll see why
        it caught my eye! But seriously... we have some truly amazing info here
        in this interview on the show and maybe some other things...

        <p class="interview-q">
          This time, this Japan show "In Between Dreams" is called a world
          premiere, but what is the theme or concept of this program?
        </p>
        <p class="interview-a">
          It's even in the title, the concept is "dreams". The Residents have
          chosen songs that meet this concept from their vast repertoire for
          this show. Also, for the show, there are videos produced with
          characters talking about "dreams". This time the costumes are modeled
          after plague doctors. These doctors believe that disease has spread
          all over the world, and they believe that it can be cured only by
          dreams created by The Residents or escaping to created worlds.
        </p>

        <p class="interview-q">
          Why was Japan chosen as the place for the world premiere?
        </p>

        <p class="interview-a">
          Since The Residents first performed in Japan in 1985, I think they've
          always wanted to come back. There were plans for a small Japan tour in
          2011, but they were canceled by the earthquake disaster. So this time,
          when they heard from the agent that there was potential for being able
          to go to the Blue Note Tokyo, they were really looking forward to it.
        </p>

        <p class="interview-q">
          How did you come to this work, or what was it's motivation?
        </p>

        <p class="interview-a">
          The beginning motivation was this Japanese show. The Residents weren't
          planning anything in particular for their 2017 tour. But their
          motivation for new works was inspired from this unexpected offer.
        </p>

        <p class="interview-q">
          How is it related to past work of The Residents?
        </p>

        <p class="interview-a">
          Basically it's just new arrangements of existing works. However, there
          are also some new songs unveiled, and some from a new project, "The
          Fixie Man" will be performed.
        </p>

        <p class="interview-q">Can we hear a bit more about "The Fixie Man"?</p>

        <p class="interview-a">
          It's a very dramatic project based on an albino blues singer from the
          1960's.
        </p>

        <p class="interview-q">
          Is there any relationship between the new Residents album "The Ghost
          of Hope" and "In Between Dreams"? And if so, what is it?
        </p>

        <p class="interview-a">
          They will also be playing songs from The Ghost of Hope on this stage.
          The Ghost of Hope is themed around train accidents, and it's also a
          metaphor for the darkness of western civilization. The darkness cannot
          vanish until the world learns how to dream again. The Residents have
          appeared to help with that.
        </p>

        <p class="interview-q">
          It's the first time in 37 years that The Residents have come to Japan,
          but in those 37 years, have their been any changes in The Residents?
          Can I please get the facts?
        </p>

        <p class="interview-a">
          The years have piled on, they've grown wiser, and they have children
          and even grandchildren. Hair has become grey, and they don't eat as
          much as they used to. But they are by no means gloomy, and even now
          get excited to discover fun day by day.
        </p>

        <p class="interview-q">
          A few comments on arriving at 45 years of your activities. Are there
          any special feelings?
        </p>

        <p class="interview-a">
          It feels like a very long time has passed since the beginning of The
          Residents. However, the future is always open just like it was 45
          years ago, and they are still full of new ideas.
        </p>

        <p class="interview-q">
          If you could describe 45 years of The Residents in one word, how would
          you?

          A stage show based on the 1988 album "God in Three Persons" is in
          production. Also, they're starting to rebuild the experimental film
          "Vileness Fats" which had its production stopped incomplete in the
          70's.

          Is there taboo for The Residents? If so, what kind of things?
        </p>

        <p class="interview-a">The Residents don't like rules.</p>

        <p class="interview-q">What is The Residents' favorite food?</p>

        <p class="interview-a">
          Well to start, The Residents is a 4 person group so each has their own
          favorite.
        </p>

        <p class="interview-q">
          This is a very difficult question, but if The Residents were forced to
          be pushed into a music genre, where would they be? (Multiple genres
          are acceptable)
        </p>

        <p class="interview-a">
          The Residents will only be categorized into their own genres.
        </p>

        <p class="interview-q">
          What are The Residents' thoughts on US President Donald Trump?
        </p>

        <p class="interview-a">
          They try not to think about him as much as possible, but that's
          difficult. He is certainly "The Ghost of Nope".
        </p>

          The new costume for "In Between Dreams" was shocking. What will the
          sound be like? It would be fortunate if you could see it in a dream.
          Make the eyeballs long and let's wait.

          A unit engulfed in an excessively big mystery, The Residents have
          accomplished their miraculous revisit to Japan. The last time they
          performed in Japan was in 1985. I was surely just getting out of
          middle school when the live review and artist photographs published in
          the magazine "Takarajima" came before my eyes. As I saw those outfits
          that were like a combination of space aliens and masked wreslters I
          grieved over the misfortune that I could not attend the performance.
          "I want to see them live someday", I thought with resolution. In other
          words, I was drawn in from their outward appearance. It's been close
          to 20 years since I've started listening to their various albums
          because mass production of Japanese edition CD's have been put onto
          the market by Bomba Records. Among these is "George & James", a
          collection of George Gershwin and James Brown related songs in an
          unprecedented style, an overwhelmingly bizarre idea, a time which I
          constantly enjoy. The concept of recreating the crowds of Brown's
          famous recording, "Live at the Apollo" ('62), with electronic sounds
          of a violent speed is even now intense to my waist. [Translator's
          note: I don't get it and Google translate doesn't get it either.]

          When I first entered the venue, the curtain with the eyeball character
          familiar to fans drawn on it and the large white spheres on the
          left-hand side of the stage caught my eye. There were four members.
          Starting from the left, there was the vocalist, the keyboardist, and
          the guitarist, with the one on laptop and sense drum positioned behind
          the keyboardist. The vocalist was wearing a black and white skin-tight
          suit resembling a cow costume. Horns were sprouting from his head and
          his stomach band were charming. The other members were disguised as
          birds with giant beaks. This time they're tackling the world premiere
          performance of their new show, "In Between Dreams". I'm writing to
          avoid spoilers to some degree. The show's contents comprise of 3
          parts: "The Cowboy Dream", "The Train Wreck Dream", and "The Ballerina
          Dream". I could appreciate the varied singing voice which I wanted to
          call the "Rainbow Voice". A roaring low voice, a husky harsh voice,
          changing to Bruce Lee's weird bird call like sounds to a roar, and so
          on... my delight was just growing from being able to enjoy these at
          point-blank range. I also listened to an extremely creatively arranged
          cover of James Brown's famous ballad "It's a Man's Man's Man's World"
          (not included in "George and James").

          Performances will be done until the 23rd. After starting almost 50
          years ago, The Residents' one and only world only gets more polished.
