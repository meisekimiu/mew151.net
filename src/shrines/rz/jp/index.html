        Beginning in October 2016 on the <em>Talk of Creatures</em> forum, I
        started a thread titled <em>The Residents in Japan.</em> While I'd only
        post intermittently, the idea behind this thread was to highlight a part
        of The Residents' world that was mysterious to us english speakers:
        their popularity and presence in Japan. Here's the intro post:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        I see plenty of information out there about various aspects of Residents
        history, but one thing that I see almost nothing about at all is The
        Residents' brief period of popularity in Japan. It is kind of
        understandable, seeing how The Residents have never been defined by
        their popularity overseas... or their popularity at all. They are and
        really should only be defined by their actual art. That being said, a
        bit of history about the group can't hurt, especially since their
        success in Japan was the whole reason behind them doing the 13th
        Anniversary Tour after previously swearing never to tour again! Looking
        at this stuff can teach us about both The Residents, Japanese culture,
        and ourselves! Or something, I don't know.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This look into Residents history ended up becoming more relevant than
        expected, as The Residents ended up premiering their
        <em>In Between Dreams</em> tour in Tokyo, Japan. I went from covering
        mysteries of the past to breaking news about the show and teasers for
        new albums The Residents would mention in Japanese exclusive interviews.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research eventually evolved into the
        <a
          href="https://homeageconversations.com/archive/episode/7"
          title="Apparently the background music to this episode is special in some way."
          >Home Age Conversations podcast episode on the 13th Anniversary
          Tour,</a
        >
        which also covered a primer on The Residents' history in Japan leading
        up to the <q>Eyeball Show</q> that happened in Tokyo and Kyoto back in
        the 1980's.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here we are today. The latest evolution of this concept is this very
        page! While this is mostly an archive of those old posts, I do want to
        eventually post more stuff, as I <em>have</em> done more research since
        that <abbr title="Home Age Conversations">HAC</abbr> episode and I'm
        excited to write about it!

          The Residents came back to Japan in 2017 and here's my coverage from
          back then.
