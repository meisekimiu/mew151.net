        The following text is an archived version of my original forum posts
        about The Residents in Japan. I've done more research since making those
        posts, so I'll try to add additional context if I get something horribly
        wrong.

            tags in the files so the correct titles and artist info show up all
            nicely. Unfortunately, the information was all translated in English
            as opposed to being in the original language it was in! I didn't
            realize it at the time and got rather confused later on when talking
            to some other people about song titles... I had gotten used to the
            English translated titles while obviously everyone else was using
            the Japanese names. Nowadays I try to at least double check that
            program when ripping my CDs, or fill in the info myself so I know
            it's right.</span

        Most Japanese Residents releases don't have different names in Japanese
        and English. Actually, all albums have been released under their
        original names, although a few have alternate "translated" titles to
        accompany their official title. Yeah, The Residents didn't get any
        reverse version of that whole "Sukiyaki /
        <span
          title="Wouldn't it be funny if I added furigana that just said すきやき"
          >上を向いて歩こう</span
        >" treatment here.
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukiyaki_(song)#English_title"
          title="You know I used to not like this change at all, but I get it. I don't even want to know how Americans from the 60's would try to pronounce the original name. Still racist though."
          >(Does anyone get that reference?)</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, these albums have been released under their original
        names:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Duck Stab / ダック・スタブ (Dakku Sutabu)</li>
        <li>Eskimo / エスキモー (Esukimou)</li>
        <li>
          Meet The Residents / ミート・ザ・レジデンツ (Miito Za Rejidentsu)
        </li>
        <li>The Big Bubble / ザ・ビッグ・バブル (Za Biggu Baburu)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (Note: for the rest of this post when I write romanized Japanese, I'll
        be writing out English loan words in standard english instead of their
        romanized Japanese forms for clarity.)
      </p>

      <p>
        These album titles tend to be written with Japanese characters on the
        obi
        <span
          title="or more clearly: the thing that makes collectors freak out if it's missing"
          >(the little paper thing on the side of the album)</span
        >
        and in the liner notes and such, but the album art is obviously not
        touched and these releases make it very clear what the original title in
        English is. And just as a reminder, in case it wasn't obvious by the
        re-romanized titles I wrote, these titles are just the English titles
        but written with Japanese characters. They are pronounced pretty the
        same, albeit with slight differences in pronunciation due to the nature
        of Japanese language.
      </p>

      <ins class="correction" datetime="2023-07-08"
        >Eventually I do want to go through some examples of some more dramatic
        differences in packaging between Japanese and English releases of
        Residents projects that I've found since I originally posted this six
        years ago. But that's for another time. ;)</ins
      >

      <p>
        And for the most part, all releases have been released with titles like
        these. Those were just some examples that I find everywhere when looking
        for Rz info in Japanese.
      </p>

      <p>
        But check
        <a
          href="http://diskunion.net/avant/ct/news/article/2/23281"
          title="kicking myself over this bad link design. i swear i try to use better link text these days"
          >THESE</a
        >
        out! If you notice on that page, you'll see they have pictures of obi
        from Residents albums, AND they have additional translated titles to go
        along with the standard English title! I don't know if these are based
        on any original WAVE releases, or if this was something made for a
        special CD rerelease. But I do find it pretty interesting.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Intermission</strong> has
        <a href="obi_RESIDENTS_intermission_0520.jpg" title="...wan kenobi"
          >an Obi</a
        >
        that translates the title as 「<ruby
          >幕間<rp>(</rp><rt>まくあい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby
        >（インターミッション）」 ("Makuai (Intermission)") which can be
        translated as... "Intermission (Intermission)" (where the second
        "Intermission" is literally the English word "Intermission" written out
        with Japanese characters).
      </p>

      <p>
        <a
          href="RESIDENTS_MarkOfTheMole_obi.jpg"
          title="This link text is slightly better but still cringe"
          >This Mark of the Mole release</a
        >
        also refers to it as 「もぐらの<ruby
          >通<rp>(</rp><rt>とお</rt><rp>)</rp>り</ruby
        ><ruby>道<rp>(</rp><rt>みち</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>」 ("Mogura no
        Toorimichi") which can be translated as "The Passage of Moles". One
        interesting thing here is that they are using the Japanese word for mole
        instead of simply writing "mole" as a loan word. It's kind of weird
        because they aren't literally moles, they're people are just referred to
        as "Moles". It's just a name. I guess they are kind of like symbolic
        moles, but whatever. Although if they did write it as an English loan
        word, it'd be kind of confusing since they'd be writing out as
        「モール」 which is usually the word for "Mall".
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, on that release we have some translated track names! After
        translating these... it appears to be more than just Mark of the Mole!
        The titles are pretty simple and for the most part good translations,
        although one of them from the second half of the CD definitely stands
        out from the short and direct translations.

      <p>
        First off, this looks like a pretty interesting release, a combination
        Mark of the Mole / Intermission CD (or Double LP?). Again, the titles
        are pretty simple, and with the exception of The Final Confrontation and
        Would We Be Alive, the translations are all pretty good. The title that
        sticks out to me, though, is
        <strong lang="ja"
          >「もぐらがやってくる&emsp;ヤァ！！ヤァ！！ヤァ！！」</strong
        >
        I really just... don't know why they added that last part. It's not like
        it's in the actual song. Maybe it was for spacing on the Obi design.
      </p>

      <ins class="correction" datetime="2023-07-11"
        >In hindsight, they probably just added that to the end of the track
        name because it's fun.</ins
      >

      <p>
        Anyway,
        <a
          href="RESIDENTS_TWO%20CITIES_obi.jpg"
          title="I had to pull this one from the wayback machine."
          >here's another Obi image</a
        >
        that's big enough to actually read! This one is for
        <strong>The Tunes of Two Cities</strong>, also referring to it as
        「<ruby lang="ja">二大都市<rp>(</rp><rt>にだいとし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby
        >のメロディー」 ("Nidaitoshi no Melody") which can be translated as "The
        Melody of Two Big Cities". They probably chose the word "Melody" to use
        instead of "Tune" because it's a more familiar and common loan word. I
        don't think it's the best translation because it's implying that the
        cities are both huge metropolitan areas, which I don't really get from
        the album. Also because the english title is sort of playing with the
        title of A Tale of Two Cities, and the Japanese title doesn't play with
        the Japanese title of the book (二都物語). To be fair, though, I can't
        really think of a way to reference that title either. Anyway, here are
        the translated track names:
      </p>

        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        I'm guessing there is more to the release... since a Tunes of Two Cities
        release without Happy Home would be very tragic, but those are the only
        titles that show up in that picture of the obi. Again, there's really
        only one title that stands out to me, which is 舌鼓を打て！ (Smack Your
        Lips (Clap Your Teeth)), mainly because of the exclamation mark. And
        because they dropped the parenthetical when translating it. One that
        sticks out to just me is probably アンヴィル・フォレスト (Anvil Forest)
        because they didn't actually translate the title and just wrote the
        english title with Japanese characters even though you can write it out
        in Japanese (Something along the lines of 鉄床森). Open Up is spelled
        out the same way, and both of those songs originally come from Residue
        so maybe they just lifted the titles from a localized
        <em>Residue</em> release?
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, these are the only translated album names and track titles that
        I could find, although if I find anymore I'll definitely post about
        them!
