      <p>
        I think ever since I started reading

        thoughts on The Residents I've felt compelled to write my own thoughts
        on The Residents and their projects. Here is a collection of my thoughts
        on various Residents projects throughout the years. Currently, most of
        these are archived versions of posts I've made elsewhere, such as fan
        forums. I plan on writing up more current reviews eventually though!
      </p>
      <p>
        The list on this page does not list The Residents' entire discography,
        and I don't think I'll ever get to a point where I do list it all.
        What's listed here are the things I have pages on.
