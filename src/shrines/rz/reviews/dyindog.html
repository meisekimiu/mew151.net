          The Residents have finally released their long awaited blues album
          after many years of foreshadowing. I originally heard a demo of “Tell
          Me” from this album back in a radio show from late 2016, and since it
          included the phrase “railroad track” in the lyrics I assumed it was a
          cut off of the then upcoming <i>Ghost of Hope</i>. However after I
          went back to that demo to listen to how it evolved between demo and
          release… I realized that this “Tell Me” song wasn’t on the album at
          all! Clearly it was related to this upcoming “Fixie Man” album that
          was teased by the <i>In Between Dreams</i> shows…
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, the blues album is finally here and with it The Residents return
          once again to one of their signature moves: playing their own takes on
          other people’s music. While it hasn’t been <i>that</i> long since the
          last project of this sort (I believe<i> Sam’s Enchanted Evening</i> is
          the last project to be made up of existing music like this, although
          2018’s <i>I Am A Resident!</i> seems like an inversion of the
          concept), it really does feel like this side of The Residents is
          coming back after a long hibernation. This <i>is</i> the first
          cover-style project done since the departure of Hardy Fox from The
          Cryptic Corporation, after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project really does feel similar in concept to earlier
          cover-based projects, with <i>Bury My Bone </i>and
          <i>River Runs Dry</i> in particular sounding like modern day
          evolutions of the songs from <i>The King and Eye</i>. The Residents
          often explore these songs in their own unique way at times. For
          instance, with<i> Bury My Bone</i>, the manic energy present along
          with the accompanying music video make the song seem more about
          powerful sexual desire that isn’t being satisfied. The original on the
          other hand has a much more somber tone that seems to focus more on the
          loneliness that comes with not having a partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking of the originals, I do believe it’s time to address the
          elephant on the train tracks here: I really do not believe for a
          second that Alvin Snow ever existed. He is just another piece of
          Residents mythology invented for this album. And Dyin’ Dog and the
          Mongrels as a band are just a persona The Residents assumed to create
          this music. It has been said that The Residents ended up canceling the
          American Composers Series because of the cost of royalties, so what
          better way to save money than to make up the artist you’re covering?
        </p>
        <p>
          This blurs the lines quite a bit between the storytelling aspect of
          The Residents and musical remixing aspect of The Residents, as Alvin
          Snow’s mythology does paint a tragic and mysterious story that are
          enhanced by his music and The Residents’ own interpretations. It
          reminds me of The Mole Trilogy’s planned method of storytelling, where
          story would be introduced in one album and a sample of in-universe
          music would go along with that story in another album.
          <i>The Big Bubble</i> is after all another record The Residents put
          out while pretending to be another band exploring their cultural
          roots.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is a difference this time. <i>The Big Bubble</i> was
          presented as a fictional album from the very beginning. It is marketed
          as an album by The Residents who are pretending to be The Big Bubble
          in their fictional universe. But last year’s Alvin Snow box set from
          Psychofon Records has a different concept attached to it. The
          assumption is that the records included in the box set are the real
          physical demo records that were originally found by Roland Sheehan
          (despite the obviously modern manufacturing methods that break
          immersion slightly). And the assumption with
          <i>Metal, Meat &amp; Bone</i> is that Alvin Snow is real and this
          itself is a real tribute to his work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not entirely sure what the purpose of this stunt is, but it’s
          being delivered with a level of seriousness beyond what they’ve done
          with their mythology before. It could just be that The Residents
          wanted to explore the genre of blues and invented an alter ego to
          perform it out, and if any blues snobs out there criticized them for
          their take on the blues, they could just blame it on their fake
          persona instead. But I have to wonder if this project’s purpose wasn’t
          just to explore the sound of the blues, but also to explore the sound
          of The Residents themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask yourself what it means for something to sound “Residential”. I’m
          sure The Residents have wondered what that is themselves many times
          over their career, but especially so in these years after the
          departure of Hardy Fox. In making this album, The Residents first had
          to pretend to be someone else. Someone who did <i>not</i> sound like
          The Residents. And then in their reinterpretations of these songs they
          had to make them sound <i>especially</i> Residential. In a way these
          covers remind me of the purpose of Santa Dog throughout the years as a
          way of saying “This is what we sound like now. This is what
          ‘Residential’ means now.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the planned (and unfortunately delayed due to the ongoing
          pandemic) “Dog Stab!” tour will expand on this concept, by taking
          these Alvin Snow originals and juxtaposing them against the songs of
          <i>Duck Stab,</i> the album that continues to define what
          “Residential” means. The tour is pretty far away from now, so who
          knows how this concept will change within the next year. But I’m
          excited to see if it adds any additional context to this album.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Metal Meat &amp; Bone</i> is a good album. And I’m so excited to
          see where The Residents go from here in this new, horrifying decade.
