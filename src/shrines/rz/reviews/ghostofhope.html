          The “Real” Residents shall be releasing their new album, The Ghost of
          Hope, some time later this month. It’s pretty exciting, since it’ll be
          their first new studio album in a couple of years now. It’s the first
          big studio release since I’ve actually become a fan of The Residents
          (obviously live albums and a few projects like Mush-Room came out
          prior, but this is the first <strong>big</strong> album release since
          then!).
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, due to certain circumstances (read: a store accidentally stocked
          some CDs they shouldn’t have yet), I own the album now! I’m not really
          into doing album reviews that much… but I have the album early!

            title="Except every time I get a CD arrives in the mail before stores would even be open in Japan"
            >How many other times will this privilege even come?</span
          >
          I <em>have</em> to do a review! Let’s begin!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> I will be trying to avoid too many “spoilers”
          for the album, but if you’re afraid of spoilers you really shouldn’t
          be reading this review anyway. Also I want to include at least enough
          details in this review to prove that I do indeed have a real copy of
          the album.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Other note:</strong> I’m writing this album as a Residents
          fan, so if you don’t know anything about The Residents… well, this
          review isn’t going to make a lot of sense.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>“My poor, poor, beautiful machine.” (The Ghost of Hope)</h3>

        <p>
          <em>The Ghost of Hope</em> definitely sounds different from any other
          Residents project so far… although that’s a good way to describe
          literally any of their other albums. I do feel like their sound for
          the past 5 or so years seemed a bit… stale, at least for The
          Residents. This album definitely has a new sound to it, which is
          pretty reassuring for me. I was afraid that maybe The Residents would
          just be stuck with their post-<em>Bunny Boy</em> sound for the rest of
          their existence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Part of this change may have something to do with “Charles Bobuck”’s
          departure from the group, but I’ve heard that Bobuck still left his
          fingerprints all over the production of this project. I think it’s
          more just because this is a new project, with new collaborators, new
          moods to portray, and new ideas to reflect. Of course it has a
          different sound.
        </p>

        <p>
          And yet, this album still sounds like this strange amalgamation of all
          their previous works. It reminds me of <em>Freak Show</em>. It reminds
          me of <em>The Gingerbread Man</em>. It reminds me of
          <em>The Talking Light</em> and <em>Shadowland</em>. It reminds me of
          <em>The Voice of Midnight</em>, and <em>Tweedles</em>, and
          <em>God in Three Persons</em>, <em>Eskimo</em>, and even
          <em>The Big Bubble</em> for some reason. It has this very familiar
          sound and yet it’s all mixed together in this particular ratio that
          makes everything sound fresh and new. It really made me think, “My
          god… I really am listening to <em>new</em> Residents!”
        </p>

        <p>
          The sounds of this album are truly incredible. The Residents have
          constructed “soundscapes” in the past with things like
          <em>Eskimo</em>, but they truly master it in
          <em>The Ghost of Hope</em>. The scenes they create are amazing, and
          for all the chaos and grimness they portray, they are strangely a
          delight on the ears. The album veers on and off the tracks between
          portraying more “soundscape” like music and well, actual honest-to-god
          <em>music</em>. I was kind of feeling bad for wanting to tap my foot
          and bob my head up and down to such carnage. There’s also some Talking
          Light style first-person narration going on in this album, but it
          doesn’t make it this album’s gimmick. It’s actually interesting how
          every song is done at least slightly differently so the only true
          thing tying them together is the central theme of train wrecks.
        </p>

        <p>
          And even for being about something as macabre as train wrecks and
          having the spooky name <em>The Ghost of Hope</em>, the album still
          managed to surprise me with how dark it was. It’s pretty gloomy and
          depressing, and the fact that songs are based on actual
          (<em>Real?</em>) events that happened just makes it all the more
          emotional. It’s a very haunting album and listening to it reminded me
          of listening to the depressing stories of
          <em>The Gingerbread Man</em> for the first time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now then, time to pretend like I’m Grandpa Gio for a second. The
          eyeballs are back, and prominently displayed on the album art for the
          first time on a major album release since <em>Demons Dance Alone</em>,
          I think? This means a few things. First off, The Residents are acting
          as observers, which is pretty clear from the concept of the album as
          well as the pictures in the booklet showing the eyeball-headed
          Residents calmly, almost playfully observing these train wrecks. But
          it also means that we’re dealing with commentary on our culture as
          well.
        </p>

        <p>
          The railroad is so romantic and idealistic, but these disasters show
          another side of these ideals. These trains were technological marvels
          at the time, but we failed to control this technology properly. The
          Residents are asking “But have we learned from our mistakes?” when it
          comes to all these newer technologies we’re developing… which is part
          of what makes this album so haunting.
        </p>

        <p>
          <ins datetime="2022-02-19"
            >Judging from the recent NFT things The Residents have done, I think
            we know the answer to that question. The Ghost of Hope says
            <q><strong>NO!</strong></q></ins
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          One final thing to note about the eyeballs is that it means that the
          “Randy, Chuck, and Bob” idea seems to be gone… at least to a certain
          extent. This seems to be emphasized by the
          <strong>“Real? Residents”</strong> brand that is present on the back
          of the cover, as well as all over the insides of the booklet. At first
          I thought it might just be a small little brand that would be placed
          on the cover as a joke, but its prominence on the inside covers is
          pretty intriguing. I don’t really know what it means just yet… I think
          we might have to wait for the <em>In Between Dreams</em> shows or
          maybe just hindsight a year or two down the road to really see what’s
          so “Real?” about them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyway, this album is pretty great. Go preorder it… it is simply
          fantastic and I’m very happy to own it right now.
