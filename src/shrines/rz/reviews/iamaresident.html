          I just listened to I Am A Resident for the first time. HOLY EYEBALLS
          IT'S AMAZING!
        </p>

        <p>
          I mean, I was expecting to like it since most of the songs covered in
          this album I like, but WOW. The remix concept is really what pushes
          this album from "cool fan compilation, Eyesore 2.0" to the advertised
          "NEW CONCEPT FROM THE RESIDENTS". It is fantastic. It really is a new
          Residents album, and it's pretty sweet.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like the little radio framing device they use to open and close the
          album. It's cute and makes the album feel like this big event... I'm
          not sure properly how to explain it. Somehow it makes it feel more
          like "oh yeah, these people ARE Residents!" Honestly it reminds me of
          those 1 hour megamixes pop radio stations play on the weekends (...
          not that I listen to pop music radio...). It's a pretty genius way to
          frame this album because well... the remix concept really does make
          this a megamix in a way. I mean it's just one hour of straight
          Residential chaos and it's awesome.
        </p>

        <p>
          The whole remix thing adds another layer to the thing as well. Because
          all the covers blend together and "The Real Residents?" add new
          textures (AND LYRICS!) on top of them, this really feels like "Our
          Finest Flowers 2". Which is pretty sweet! Honestly? I kind of like
          this more as a "Residents play The Residents" album compared to Our
          Finest Flowers. Maybe because we live in the future where computer
          synthesized music sounds better and we have even more Rz material to
          choose from. Maybe it's because the songs are longer and mixed
          together so they have time to flow between vastly more songs AND the
          songs get to live on their own for a bit instead of just being
          squashed together into one single song. Maybe because that cute radio
          thing and the "I Am A Resident theme" at the end made it more special.
          I don't know but I love it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm honestly surprised that they thought of this project back in 2013.
          I mean, at this point I'm used to knowing that Residents albums take
          years to develop from just the basic idea, but wow... unlike whatever
          the "Blues Album" is going to be called, this one kind of just laid
          hidden for quite a while until they actually unveiled the pledgemusic
          campaign. It's weird that this Residents album was originally imagined
          up right when I became a "proper" Residents fan... and it just came
          out and I'm just now listening to it. Crazy!
        </p>

        <p>
          I lack the musical talent to have properly contributed to the
          project... and even if I did, I had no money while the pledgemusic
          campaign was running. So do I consider myself to be a Resident? Maybe.
          Just maybe.

          This follow up was posted a couple days later on

          You are actually required by law to listen to this album if you are a
          Rz fan.
        </p>

        <p>
          I should mention a few more things I forgot to write in my post. I was
          really surprised that this was a new Residents album. I was kind of
          just glossing this one over, partly because the fan concept meant this
          wasn't the "Real Residents?", and partly because Intruders the "next
          studio album" was coming out pretty soon. I mean, I preordered
          Intruders a couple of days before I Am A Resident came out, and this
          time I decided to buy the CD <i>and</i> the vinyl because it's a "real
          album". The day I Am A Resident arrived I didn't even really think to
          myself, "I'm going to listen to a new Residents album today", because
          deep down I didn't consider it a new album at the time.
        </p>

        <p>
          After I listened to it I realized how special this album really was.
          It really hit me with these complicated emotions I've felt in
          Residents projects before, but never mixed together like this. I've
          listened to <i>Eyesore</i> a few times, and overall I like a lot of
          the covers in that compilation. For every cover there is a bit of
          respect I feel for what they do with it; I think every song in
          <i>Eyesore</i> is different enough from the source to come with a
          "huh... so that's how The Residents have impacted you?" kind of
          appreciation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Our Finest Flowers</i> mixes concepts in an interesting way.
          Connections between Residents works that didn't exist before are
          explored in a way that's like crossing your senses together. Hearing
          familiar melodies and lyrics flow into other familiar melodies and
          lyrics was a true joy... and shock as well.
          <i
            >(Note: I should mention that when I first listened to
            <i>Our Finest Flowers</i> I was probably only familiar with about
            20% of the source material)</i
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          The latest Residents live shows have radically transformed the
          existing sounds of The Residents' previous (and in some cases, present
          <i>and</i> future as well) works. I mean, I guess the old Residents
          live shows have too, but these more modern shows transform the source
          material much more than just adapting the song to what a live band can
          practically produce. The exciting thing about hearing one of these new
          performances for the first time is that at the start of every song it
          can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what song they're playing. The
          melody seems so familiar... and when you finally realize what song
          they're playing it's so exciting. OMG! They're playing
          <i>this song</i>, I've only listened to it hundreds of times, and it
          only took me a minute to figure it out!
        </p>

        <p>
          So, all of those emotions are combined in this album. Every new cover
          introduced tends to confuse me for a few seconds while I figure out
          what they're actually playing, then I feel joy and excitement when I
          realize what it is. Then I think "wow, this is an interesting
          interpretation of the original song. GOOD COVER!". Then it flows into
          another song and I think "WOW this is a connection I've never made
          before!". And it keeps on going until the end.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, there are some special moments in this album that fit
          outside of this emotional loop. The endings of most of the tracks of
          the album are quite special, the ending of the "Lingering Illusions"
          in particular messed me up a great deal. Also the ending to the album
          as a whole is just... silly, beautiful, triumphant, and... well...
          special! The last bit of the actual "megamix" as I described it
          earlier is also just... wow. As I was hearing the final moments of all
          these weird covers it blended into one last cover. It sounded familiar
          to me... what was this a cover of? And where had I heard this cover
          before? Then it hit me and I suddenly was overwhelmed by memories.
          Once that final song bit fades out, all that's left is something else
          and there is no more to say.
