          I liked the idea of collecting my thoughts on Residents albums right
          when they came out, and I wanted to make it a recurring thing on my
          blog to review the newest Residents albums. Maybe the goal was that
          I'd eventually have a collection of first impressions similar to that
          of

          Anyways... it's been several years and I only have two such posts. For
          some reason, when <em>Intruders</em> came out in 2018, I never ended
          up posting my thoughts on the album at all. I think at the time it was
          just hard to collect my thoughts. In the years since, it seems that
          the general fan consensus is that <em>Intruders</em> was indeed a
          thing that happened... and not much else. Does this album even really
          have fans?
        </p>
        <p>
          When I first heard this album back in 2018 I wasn't sure what to think
          of it. The stories were spooky, and the music wasn't bad or anything.
          But unlike
          <em>Ghost of Hope</em> or <em>Metal, Meat, and Bone</em> I couldn't
          even guess as to what The Residents were trying to do or say with this
          album. All I knew was that the theme tying the album together was very
          clearly defined in the liner notes: <em>Intruders</em> is about
          doppelgangers! And ghosts. And lovers...? And arson? And a guy going
          bowling? Do scarecrows count as doppelgangers?
        </p>
        <p>
          I think this is really what made <em>Intruders</em> so difficult to me
          at the time. Even the theme that The Residents spelled out in the
          liner notes felt nebulous and fuzzy: what defined an
          <q>Intruder</q> anyway? Well, whatever, clearly within a few listens,
          I'd totally have this album figured out...
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to analyzing <em>Intruders,</em> I still like
          <a
            href="https://homeageconversations.com/archive/episode/4/part-1"
            title="Home Age Conversations: As featured in the book Faceless Forever!"
            >Home Age Conversations'</a
          >
          theory of doubles. They argue that each song in the album,
          <span title="Maybe its double is the single 'The Intruder'?"
            >besides the final track <em>Shadows</em>,</span
          >
          has its own thematic doppelganger.
          <span title="Also these tracks both have proper names in the title"
            >Both <em>Bobbie's Burning Blues</em> and
            <em>Frank's Lament</em> feature characters who seems to deal with
            alternate selves.</span
          >
          <em>Voodoo Doll</em> and <em>The Scarecrow</em> are both about
          humanoid but inanimate objects that nonetheless have a haunting
          presence. There are two songs about doppelgangers... the list goes on
          (although the evidence for the remaining songs is admittedly weaker; I
          feel like you could pair up the remaining songs in any combination of
          doubles and it'd make sense).
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a fun theory... but is that really all there is to say about
          this album? That they <small>maybe</small> wrote songs in doubles,
          scrambled them up, and released them with an extra closing track?
          Something still feels incomplete. And I can't put my finger on it...

            In 1982, a new entity formed as the result of natural cell division.
            As foretold in
            <a
              href="https://hardyfox.com/home/The%2520Stone/"
              title="This is one of the most important pieces of literature I have ever read"
              >The Book of IBBUR,</a
            >
            the entity known as <q>The Residents</q> would divide into two
            charged entities: the positively-charged Residents who would
            continue to exist and be perceived, and their negatively-charged TAR
            lurking in the shadows: <em>Black Tar and the Cry Babies</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, that's what Hardy Fox said in a newsletter anyway. The lore of
            his few <em>Black Tar</em> releases were that they came from this
            group that were supposed to be the <q>un-Residents</q>. They split
            off from The Residents at some point and had a whole obscure musical
            career in the meantime. But really I think it was just an excuse to
            have some fun under an alias that wasn't
            <q>The Residents.</q>
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually this mythology got pulled into the mythology behind Hardy
            Fox's character of Charles Bobuck, which got weirder and weirder
            until the character stopped existing at the end of
            <em>The Stone</em>. And I thought nothing more of it... Black Tar's
            releases established the concept of the TAR and
            <em>The Stone</em> finished said concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as I think about it more, it seems like
            <em>Black Tar and the Cry Babies</em> was really presenting a subtle
            question the whole time: What does it mean when a member of The
            Residents quits? The backstory of <em>Black Tar</em> mentions that
            the <q>cell division</q> happened in 1982, and that's
            <em>probably</em> not just a random year. In 1982, Jay Clem quit the
            Cryptic Corporation and not long after
            <span title="The President???">John Kennedy</span> left as well.
            There really was a split in The Residents at this time
            <small
              >(which may have possibly
              <a
                href="https://www.google.com/search?q=clifford+the+big+red+dog"
                title="The fanbase split into dogs and ducks"
                >split the fanbase a bit</a
              >)</small
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now John and Jay did not end up actually creating their own rock
            band double of The Residents,
            <span title="Why would it? They were just The Residents' managers."
              >and The Residents did not implode upon their departure.</span
            >
            But I'm sure as Hardy Fox was planning on retiring, there were a lot
            of questions about what was really going to happen to The Residents.
            Hardy Fox still loved to make music and it was clear that he planned
            on having a productive solo career after his departure. In a way
            Hardy Fox's departure really
            <em>was</em> going to split The Residents into two different
            entities, just as foretold by <em>Black Tar and The Cry Babies.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Since Hardy Fox had a strong influence on The Residents' sound, The
            New Residents that came out of this cell division would naturally
            sound at least a little different as new collaborators filled in
            Hardy's place. And Hardy's solo work would continue to sound
            different from The Residents. These two entities were like
            doppelgangers to each other: both a result of The Residents' cell
            division in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2017, The Residents released their train-themed
            <em>The Ghost of Hope</em>. And the same year Hardy Fox released the
            doppelganger to that album
            <a
              href="https://bobuck.bandcamp.com/album/nachtzug"
              title="You may know that I wrote a review of this album on my blog, Perfect Pop Star Paradise, several years ago."
              ><em>Nachtzug.</em></a
            >
            Perhaps the nature of this cell division was understood by The
            Residents, and they decided to write an album about this concept of
            division in the aftermath of Hardy Fox's departure... maybe. I can't
            really say for sure, but this concept of doubles reminds me a lot of
            The Residents' 2018 album <em>Intruders...</em> right?
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr class="tar-separator" />
        <p>
          As discussed in my
          <a
            href="https://blog.mew151.net/entries/dyingdog-review.html"
            title="i also linked to this post earlier lol"
            >Metal, Meat, and Bone review,</a
          >
          I think Hardy Fox's departure made The Residents focus in on the
          question <q>What do The Residents sound like now?</q> The invented
          blues persona from <em>Metal, Meat, &amp; Bone</em> was one way of
          asking this question, but what about the album that came before it?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Intruders</em> is an album made up of doubles. Doppelgangers.
          TARs. Positive and negative charges that threaten to annihilate each
          other. You can see this in the album cover itself. We see a lot of
          black and white stripes that may represent these contrasting doubles.
        </p>
        <p>
          A big visual motif of the album is mouths. We also tend to see
          distorted faces inside each big mouth. What does this imagery possibly
          have to do with this album? Maybe it's supposed to be the negative
          double of the familar Residents eyeball. Instead of a human form with
          a giant eyeball where a face should go, we get a floating face with a
          mouth surrounding it instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          This "anti-Residents" imagery matches the very title of the album as
          well. After all, what is the opposite of a resident? A landlord? Or
          maybe an Intruder? Sure... let's make an album about intruders.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times <em>Intruders</em> feels like it could be the ghostly
          doppelganger of another Residents album. It uses the same format as
          <em>Animal Lover,</em> combining songs with lyrics with stories that
          give an extra point of view to the song. The track
          <em>Still Needy</em> is actually a cover of <em>Neediness</em> from
          2002's <em>Demons Dance Alone.</em> That one in particular blew me
          away when I first heard it; outside of
          <em>Our Finest Flowers,</em> The Residents really haven't done a cover
          of one of their own songs in a standalone studio album release like
          this before. Listening to it for the first time, my only thought was
          <q>Is this even allowed???</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is just a guess that I'll never be able to confidently prove, but
          perhaps the doubling up of song themes came about from the same
          process that gave us the dual versions of songs in
          <em>Metal, Meat, &amp; Bone?</em> In other words, perhaps each pair of
          thematic doubles (Bobbie &amp; Frank, Voodoo &amp; Scarecrow, etc)
          represent the divergent ideas between The Residents and their double:
          The Intruders.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is, of course, just a silly theory. But... one interesting thing
          is that for each pair of songs that share a theme, The Singing
          Resident is <em>always</em> present in at least one of the songs. That
          means that among the many guest singers
          <small>(are <em>they</em> technically Intruders?)</small> who show up
          in this album, they are never pitted against each other as
          doppelgangers, but instead their songs are always contrasted with one
          sung by The Singing Resident. Under my theory, The Singing Resident's
          song would represent something that sounds traditionally
          <q>residential</q>, and the Guest Singer's song would be the
          <span title="They should have called the album Sussy Imposters"
            >Intruder.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          (I do think that the concept of <q>Intruders</q> the album brings up
          are supposed to be the <q>Anti-Reisdents,</q> but I'm not fully sure
          about this double songs theory from Home Age Conversations. This is
          just a fun consequence of trying to reconcile both theories at once.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm kind of glad I waited so long to write up this blog post, with the
          hindsight I now have after the release of
          <em>Metal, Meat, &amp; Bone.</em> I should also note that while I
          liked the album when it first came out, I really began to
          <em>click</em> with the album much later as I was going through some
          life struggles. The idea of these psychic intruders in the album
          really resonated with me since uh... my mental health state wasn't the
          best in those days. And poor mental health really feels like something
          is just... <em>intruding.</em> I went through a phase where I thought
          that <em>Intruders</em> was actually about mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always appreciated <em>Intruders,</em> but as time has gone on
          I've become a real fan of the album.
          <small>(The sole fan of Intruders???)</small>
          <em>Intruders</em> solidified the roles of several new collaborators
          that have worked with The Residents since, so it really feels like a
          good stepping stone between the transitional
          <em>Ghost of Hope</em> and what the group has accomplished since in
          the 2020's. I'm a bit sad to see that most Residents fans don't really
          think much of <em>Intruders.</em> But I guess it makes sense; it would
          be a bit awkward to be a fan of your favorite band's doppelganger.
