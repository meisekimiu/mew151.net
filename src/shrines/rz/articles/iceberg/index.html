      <h1>The Residents Iceberg</h1>
      <h2>(An exploration of a meme image I made years ago)</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever seen an
        <a
          href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/iceberg-charts"
          title="No, but I have a surface level understanding."
          gmi-footnote="Know Your Meme: Iceberg Charts"
          >Iceberg Chart Meme</a
        >
        before? It is a kind of meme format that explores a topic starting first
        with subtopics that are on "the surface" and well known before
        descending into darker and more obscure subtopics. Often these charts
        are exaggerated with creepy or conspiratorial fake items mixed in with
        real to give the impression that the topic might be scarier than one
        would initially think on first glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first discovered this meme format in the summer of 2020 when I ran
        into the
        <a
          href="sm64-iceberg.png"
          title="An ally with info told me that every version of this iceberg chart is personalized."
          >Super Mario 64 Iceberg Chart.</a
        >
        This image kind of stuck with me because I found it a very fascinating
        way of conveying real obscure information about Super Mario 64 while
        also including items that were obviously fake but still painted such a
        vivid image in my mind. It was such a clever way of delivering some a
        good mix of comedy and horror.
      </p>
      <p>
        So eventually I decided to make my own iceberg chart focused on The
        Residents and I posted it to Twitter on a Residents meme account I
        managed at the time. I think it got a few likes and retweets. A few
        years later, I was idling in a fan-run Residents discord server and just
        happened to catch some folks trying to decipher some Residents iceberg
        charts, and perhaps combine them into a MEGA iceberg chart and explain
        it all. But some of the entries in my iceberg in particular were
        mysterious even to the kinds of Residents fans who would save and
        analyze it years later.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I thought... why not present my iceberg chart here on my website and
        explain all of the entries? I'll explain which items are real, which
        ones are fake, and perhaps you'll even find some obscure insider
        information I snuck into this Twitter shitpost...

            but was famously recorded years prior to release. Initially it was
            supposed to never come out until The Residents forgot its contents
            in observation of the <em>Theory of Obscurity</em>, but according to
            legend, The Cryptic Corporation finally released it in 1978 when The
            Residents ran off with the master tapes to their upcoming album
            <em>Eskimo</em>.

            There has been some fan discussion as to whether the 1974 recording
            date is fully true. Compared to the material in
            <em>Meet The Residents,</em> released the same year, it feels much
            more advanced and some have noted that the synths in particular feel
            more similar to Side B of 1976's <em>The Third Reich 'n Roll</em>.
            Some official sources have confirmed that some parts of the final
            album were recorded after the initial recording sessions in
            1974.<sup

            Depending on the fan, the "real" date for <em>Not Available</em> can
            range from 1974-1978.

            This theory makes a lot of sense, but because <em>Duck Stab</em> is
            the most popular Residents album and is more disjointed than some of
            The Residents' "real" concept albums, this observation is placed at
            the surface level of the iceberg.

            Not everyone thinks this song's just about heaven, by the way. I
            tend to appreciate the more creative theories about
            <em>Duck Stab</em> but... yeah I can't really argue with the common
            interpretation.

            The Cryptic Corporation, the management company for The Residents
            and Ralph Records, was originally composed of four members: Homer
            Flynn, Hardy Fox, Jay Clem, and John Kennedy. In the early 1980s,
            both Jay Clem and John Kennedy left The Cryptic Corporation for
            various businessy reasons.<sup

            There's a bit of conflict in The Residents fanbase over these
            departures, with some people saying that The Residents were never
            the same after this. Personally, I don't see why people would care
            about some business people departing from their management company,
            but maybe I'm just missing something.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

            In 2019 in preparation for the release of The Residents' upcoming
            <em>Metal, Meat, and Bone</em> some strange things happened across
            the world wide web. It seems like The Residents were starting to
            plant the seeds for a sort of

            for a 45rpm record from an obscure artist named "Dyin' Dog" was
            created. It ended without much fanfare and only one bid. Not too
            long after this, the auction was brought to greater attention when
            another piece of the game dropped on the Tumblr blog "The Chiseler":

          </p>

            This is probably the most incorrectly categorized items in the whole
            iceberg chart. I originally made this meme in 2020 when this
            incident was more in recent memory. I think nowadays I'd probably
            put this way deeper on the iceberg.

            The Residents are a famously anonymous band.<sup
              >[citation needed]</sup
            >
            And because the identities of The Residents are officially hidden,
            people become naturally curious about who they really are. It often
            feels like one of the big unsolved mysteries about The Residents is
            their identity... but it really isn't.
          </p>
          <p>
            I won't be naming theme here, but it's not really a difficult thing
            to find so to many serious fans it's not much of a mystery that
            keeps us up at night. If you really want to know who they are you
            can find it out yourself. It turns out it's not that great of a
            mystery when there are so many other more interesting questions to
            ask about The Residents instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so I put this in the surface level category as a bit of a nod to
            how surface-level this mystery is.

            In the first half of the 1980's The Residents released multiple

            The first album of this series was
            <em>Mark of the Mole,</em> released in 1981. This was followed by
            "Part 2" of the series, <em>The Tunes of Two Cities</em> in 1982.
            And a few years later, <em>The Big Bubble</em> was released as "Part
            4" of the series. Parts 3, 5, and 6 of the "trilogy" were never
            finished.

            He recognizes an interesting pattern in the lore of the Mole
            Trilogy. In <em>The Tunes of Two Cities</em> we are first introduced
            to the concept of the "Mohelmot" language found in the field
            recordings of Mole music (though <em>The Big Bubble</em> calls
            attention to this language for the first time). But the Chubs just
            speak plain old english in their recordings. This fact and the
            presence of <em>Happy Home</em> (which is hinted to be a song that's
            from an in-universe musical of some sorts) in the beginning of
            <em>Mark of the Mole</em> could point to the fact that
            <em>Mark of the Mole</em> is <em>also</em> an in-universe recording
            much like <em>Tunes</em> and <em>Bubble</em>. And specifically, a
            recording of some kind of stage production done by the Chub culture
            instead of the Mole culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we then wanted to sort all the existing Mole Trilogy albums
            chronologically, the order would go:
          </p>
          <ol style="margin-left: 2em" start="2">
            <li>
              <em>The Tunes of Two Cities:</em> The album consists of
              in-universe recordings of each culture's music before their
              integration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Mark of the Mole:</em> A story of the integration of Moles
              into Chub culture, told by the Chubs after it happened.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>The Big Bubble:</em> An in-universe album produced decades
              after the original conflict in <em>Mark of the Mole</em>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            (This ordering would point to a lost Part 1 of the trilogy, perhaps
            under this reading this missing piece is the Moles' own lived
            experience and culture that has been erased by the Chubs?)
          </p>
          <p>
            And so, under Grandpa Gio's theory, <em>Mark of the Mole</em> is
            Part 3 of the Mole Trilogy... though to be clear this is just some
            old guy's fun theory. Official sources all seem to point to the fact
            that The Residents consider <em>Mark of the Mole</em> Part 1 and
            that the "real" Part 3 was in development but was never finished.

            There is a fringe theory about <em>The Commercial Album</em> that
            I've seen in a few places. The theory goes that there's some kind of
            hidden narrative running through <em>The Commercial Album's</em> 40
            tracks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Believers will often point to tracks like <em>Amber</em> and
            <em>Red Rider</em>, which seem like they could be about the same
            character. If you keep trying to connect the tracks, you might end
            up with something feeling like a full narrative. Others may also
            think that <em>The Commercial Album</em> secretly foreshadows future
            Residents projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's likely this is all just coincidence. There are
            <em>forty</em> whole tracks in the base release of
            <em>The Commercial Album</em> and since they're all generally by the
            same authors it's pretty likely you're going to see some repeated
            themes. And in the case of "secret foreshadowing", the same
            principle applies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The "official" concept behind <em>The Commercial Album</em> is a
            statement on the nature of popular commercial music.<sup

            No official sources have backed up any other "narrative" theories on
            <em>The Commercial Album,</em> though you can feel free to have fun
            making your own narrative theory about the album.

            does not featuring The Singing Resident and otherwise does not
            particularly sound like The Residents. So it's unlikely that "The
            Foo Foo Heads" is some kids music alias for The Residents. Most
            likely the Foo Foo Heads were friends and just invited A Resident to
            play the part.

          <p>
            <em>Goobers</em> is a bit of an interesting album because it is a
            collaboration of many artists that had collaborated with The
            Residents or would go on to collaborate with them years later (Penn
            Jillette, Eric Drew Feldman, Joshua Raoul Brody, Steven Cerio, The
            Foo Foo Heads). However The Residents themselves are nowhere to be
            found unless they happen to be going under another alias. Were they
            involved with this album or is it all just coincidence?

            The <em>American Composers Series</em> of albums by The Residents
            consisted of 2 major releases: <em>George &amp; James</em> in 1984
            and <em>Stars &amp; Hank Forever</em> in 1986. The series itself was
            originally supposed to continue until the year 2000 with tribute
            albums to various other important American artists.<sup

            However, after those two albums the series was abandoned.
          </p>
          <p>
            This entry refers to the fact that despite the specific aims of the
            <em>American Composers Series</em> being abandoned after these two
            albums, The Residents continued to do things similar to it years
            later. It's not hard to see <em>Cube-E</em> as a sort of spiritual
            successor of the series in the way it juxtaposes various styles of
            American music. If you play along with The Residents' game, one can
            even see <em>Metal, Meat, &amp; Bone</em> as an extension of the
            series, by directly juxtaposing Dyin' Dog to The Residents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, officially the actual
            <em>American Composers Series</em> was cancelled and these future
            projects are sufficiently different enough to not really fit in with
            the real entries anyway. The songs of <em>Cube-E</em> are not
            generally written by a singular composer and Dyin' Dog isn't a real
            guy. Plus they don't have the amazing package design that both
            <em>George &amp; James</em> and <em>Stars &amp; Hank</em> have.<sup

            <kbd>\</kbd> (backslash) and <kbd>|</kbd> (vertical bar) keys were
            mapped to output the amount of free memory in kilobytes and output
            the number of active objects in the current scene respectively. In
            addition, inputting an uppercase <kbd>F</kbd>, <kbd>M</kbd>, or
            <kbd>S</kbd> would set the "random event speed" in the game to
            "fast", "medium", or "slow" respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of the writing of this article I still have not tested if this is
            behavior remains in the release version of the game, but the text
            data I found (which is not actually fully executable game code) is
            present in the CD. I intend to revise that blog post and dive in
            deeper in the not-too-distant future though!

            he theorizes that multiple tracks from the compilation album might
            have belonged to an abandoned album about dreams. This theory
            develops further in his writeup on
            <a

            where he claims that the "unreleased"
            <em>Safety is a Cootie Wootie</em> must have also originated from
            this dreams project.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a somewhat compelling idea since multiple songs do share a
            theme on dreams, but as far as I can tell The Residents themselves
            have never mentioned an abandoned dreams album. It's more likely
            that The Residents just find the concept of dreams to be inherently
            fascinating. The first full Residents project to be fully
            thematically dedicated to dreams was the
            <em>In Between Dreams</em> tour from 2019.

            In the 1990s, the album <em>Freak Show</em> got several adaptations.
            Among these was the <em>Freak Show</em> CD-ROM game. The game was
            pretty popular, but one interesting footnote about this game's
            release is that it also had a "video tape tour" version for fans who
            didn't have computers but wanted to experience the game.<sup

            This VHS release is pretty obscure and as far as I know has never
            been digitized and archived online. I included this on the iceberg
            to reference this obscure piece of trivia, but I also misinformation
            onto it: the suggestion that there are mysterious "oddities" present
            on the VHS tape that may not be in the normal CD-ROM release.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practically speaking, the VHS tape is probably just a silent
            playthrough of the commercial release of the game. But I've never
            actually seen the tape so for all I know it could be commentated or
            be a recording of a pre-release or development build of the game.
            That's the fun of gaps in digital preservation... your imagination
            gets to go wild! Someone please digitize this so we can see how
            boring it actually is.

            Beginning in the 2010s with the <em>Talking Light</em> shows, the
            anonymous singer for The Residents finally revealed his identity to
            be Randy Rose. This was just another character by The Residents but
            it was the first time that individual band members had character
            beyond "he has a skull for a head instead of an eyeball".

            On October 31st, 2018, The Residents did a short instrumental set at

            It features an appearance by Tyrone, the pseudonym for The
            Residents' singer during the <em>In Between Dreams</em> shows but
            Tyrone's appearance during this show was similarly uncanny and
            silent like the previous Randy appearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of these incidents seem to be occurences of stand-ins playing
            the part of The Residents' singer. But I wonder what both of these
            situations have in common that would require something like that to
            occur. I simply can't think of a reason why.<sup

            In 2018 a series of album re-issues began called the pREServed
            series. These are remastered versions of the old albums packed with
            extra bonus tracks and and retrospective liner notes and previously
            unreleased goodies. Plus for some projects that are otherwise out of
            print, it's an easy way to get your hands on a copy! This isn't an
            advertisement... I'm just a fan of these rereleases!
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea that these re-issues are censored is mostly just a fake
            joke for this iceberg chart. Specifically a reference to a similar
            joke entry the Super Mario 64 iceberg chart that states "the
            decompilation [of Super Mario 64] is censored". This was one of my
            favorite lines from that iceberg chart because it's such an ominous
            idea: what if our modern source of understanding for how Super Mario
            64 works has actually been altered somehow? The Residents equivalent
            to this would of course be the idea that the pREServed editions are
            somehow altered to protect us from... <em>something</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The packaging of the pREServed release of
            <em>The Third Reich 'n Roll</em> actually <em>is</em> censored to
            remove visible nazi imagery so that it can be sold in parts of
            Europe with no issues, but as far as I can tell, no contents of any
            release have ever been altered. I think.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

            you might wonder what might Part 1 of the trilogy would be. It might
            seem like a futile search since... well there really aren't any
            other albums that identify as pieces of the Mole Trilogy. But that
            didn't stop Grandpa Gio for searching for hidden parts in his
            <a href="https://gio80.com/intermission" title="grandpa go to sleep"
              >article on <em>Intermission.</em></a
            >
            He entertains the idea that perhaps a past album could be secretly
            part of the trilogy, but concludes that none of the past Residents
            albums fit the bill so Part 3 is still forthcoming.
          </p>
          <p>
            But perhaps we can go a bit deeper if we widen our search parameters
            a little bit. Why limit ourselves to albums by The Residents? This
            line of thinking has brought me to a wacky theory about
            Snakefinger's 1980 album <em>Greener Postures.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The final track on the album is titled
            <em>"The Picture Makers Vs. Children Of The Sea"</em> and even
            features The Singing Resident on it. The song is about a conflict
            between two groups of people. The "Picture Makers", the antagonists
            from Snakefinger's perspective, are described as "living in holes
            like subterranean moles". Snakefinger heavily implies that the
            "Picture Makers" have slipped their way into society and it's up to
            <span
              title="the children of the sea be like. WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THE PICTURE MAKERS WITH A WAR AND FUCKIGN KILL THEM!!!111 >:( but otherwise we're just harmless little guys we're just innocent little guys we're just little guys we wouldn't hurt nobody :3"
              >"The Children of the Sea" to resist them.</span
            >
            Hm... now where have I heard a story about mole-like people going
            towards the sea to integrate into another society before?
          </p>
          <p>
            And because the song's similarity to the Mole Trilogy has always
            stood out to me, I added a line about
            <em>Greener Postures</em> possibly being Part 1 onto the iceberg.
            For the record, I don't <em>actually</em> believe a random
            Snakefinger album or even this single song is part of the Mole
            Trilogy. But I do seriously wonder if
            <em>The Picture Makers Vs. Children Of The Sea</em> was perhaps some
            kind of prototype for what would become The Mole Trilogy.

            The Residents have used characters throughout their career and
            sometimes the lines get fuzzy about whether someone is a character
            or a real person. Was N Senada a real guy? What about Uncle Willie?
            Grandpa Gio? Some people are even further skeptical about anyone
            who's associated with The Residents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The logical conclusion to all of this is The Residents' own
            managers. Is Homer Flynn a real guy or just a character played by
            The Residents? Isn't it suspicious how Homer Flynn and Hardy Fox had
            the same initials? Hm...
