          <p>Currently I own two accordions! Here's my collection so far:</p>

              title="My squeeze box"

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Capitol</li>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> "Custom-Built"</li>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Piano</li>
            <li><strong>Number of Keys:</strong> 41</li>
            <li><strong>Bass Buttons:</strong> 120</li>
            <li><strong>Right-Hand Registers:</strong> LMH</li>

                title="Does anyone know if there's any specific notation for bass registers? I don't think bass registers have the same standardization that the right hand registers have..."
                >3</span

            </li>
            <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Has Master Register Palm Bar</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="clear: right">
            This Capitol accordion was my very first accordion! It basically has
            all the features I wanted out of a first accordion: it has 120 bass
            buttons and LMH registers. I got it for a really good price on
            Craigslist (this is like the only real way to buy accordions btw
            lol). I have travelled with this accordion before and it was kind of
            miserable.

            This is my second (and currently newest) accordion! The Bébé Medusa
            accordion is a chromatic button accordion made for beginners by
            J-Pop/Accordion group
            <a href="https://www.charanporantan.net/" target="_blank"
              >チャラン・ポ・ランタン</a

            (Charan Po Rantan). I've been wanting to learn how to play a CBA,
            but I was afraid of buying a massive and expensive one only to find
            out I didn't like it. When I found out Charan Po Rantan were selling
            their own accordions, I knew I <em>had</em> to get one, but
            currently they seem to only be shipping them out in Japan, and as of
            this writing they haven't been taking any new orders for the last
            few months as they're still fulfilling old orders.
            <em>However...</em> I managed to find this accordion on a Japanese
            auction site. I ended up buying it and despite the fact that I had
            to pay international shipping, it was still actually one of my
            cheapest options for getting a CBA!
          </p>

            This accordion has a wonderful musette sound to it which I love a
            lot. It's a good contrast to my other accordion, and makes me feel
            confident in maybe one day buying a bigger chromatic button
            accordion!
