          <h2>How do accordions work?</h2>
          <p>
            Accordions are kind of like two giant harmonicas joined together
            with a bag of air in between them. As you push and pull the bellows,
            air flows through the reeds that are activated by the keys/buttons
            you press, and out comes sound! Like any wind instrument, the amount
            of air being used determines things like volume.
          </p>
          <h2>How do you know which button to press?</h2>
          <p>
            You may notice that on the left side of the accordion is typically a
            big collection of buttons, which seems a lot less intuitive than the
            side with a piano on it. On standard "stradella" bass accordions,
            these buttons are actually mostly chords, and they're grouped
            together in ways that are convenient for most common songs (for you
            music theory nerds, they're actually arranged in the Circle of
            Fifths!). The system is pretty easy to learn!
          </p>
          <p>
            One obvious fact you might not realize until you try picking up an
            accordion yourself for the first time is that you can't actually
            <em>see</em> the left side of the accordion at all! You're
            completely blind and have to rely on touch and muscle memory, which
            is why some buttons have marks in them similar to how a computer
            keyboard has notches on the home row keys. Even if you can look down
            at the left side on a sufficiently small accordion... it's the side
            that moves away from you, so there's really no way to ever get a
            good look at it!
          </p>
          <h2>
            What are those buttons that are next to the keyboard or bass
            buttons?
          </h2>
          <p>
            On a lot of bigger accordions, you'll find
            <em>register switches.</em> These accordions are actually equipped
            with multiple sets of reeds and clicking these switches activates
            various combinations of reeds. It's kind of like the analog version
            of switching instruments on a digital keyboard. Different registers
            can produce wildly different sounds: light high pitched tones, full
            and bassy tones, or relaxing musettes. Of course, the registers and
            reeds available depend on the accordion!
          </p>
          <h2>
            What's the difference between piano and chromatic button accordions?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Piano accordions and chromatic button accordions all play the same
            notes. That is, you can map the chromatic buttons to the same keys
            on a piano. Chromatic button accordions arrange their buttons more
            two dimensionally, meaning they can fit more buttons in less space
            than a piano can. However, chromatic button layouts actually
            duplicate buttons, meaning multiple buttons will activate the same
            exact note.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, piano accordions are easier to pick up and play if you
            even remotely know how to play piano. However, chromatic button
            accordions have various benefits as well: the smaller button profile
            usually requires less jumping around and the systems are designed in
            a way to make things like changing keys and playing chords much
            easier to do.
          </p>
          <h2>What's a diatonic button accordion?</h2>
          <p>
            Diatonic button accordions, unlike chromatic button accordions, tend
            to be smaller and have way less buttons. To get more notes out of
            them, each button actually maps to <em>two</em> notes, depending on
            whether you are pushing or pulling on the bellows! They're pretty
            popular because of their much smaller size. Plus the different
            bellows action gives a different feel to the music you're playing in
            the first place.
