        <p>This area of my site is dedicated to one of my favorite instruments: The Accordion! These days, the accordion seems to be a pretty niche instrument. A lot of people even straight up hate accordions. I want this to be a space where I can passionately write about the accordion and my journey learning it!</p>
        <h2>Why Accordion?</h2>
        <p>I just thing it's a really cool and fun instrument! It's like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDFFUIGoBUc" title="This literally sounds like a church organ wtf">handheld organ</a> you can take anywhere! It's pretty versatile as a solo instrument. And you get to hug your instrument all the time. :)</p>
        <p>I think most importantly... it's just super fun and exciting to play. The accordion is a complex piece of machinery and getting your hands to coordinate and operate it properly feels almost like you're controlling a weird steampunk mechanism... that makes music! The movement of the bellows also in a way forces you to physically entrain with the music you're playing in a way that makes it more satisfying to play the accordion compared to some other instruments I play.</p>
        <h2>My Accordion</h2>
        <p>Currently I own one (1) accordion! But I think I'm going to get another one at some point... and maybe another after that...</p>
