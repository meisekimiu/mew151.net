          <p>
            I've had friends and family try out my accordion a few times, and as
            a result I've sometimes been asked to teach them how to play a
            simple song. This request has... proven difficult since there's a
            lot to learning how to play the accordion and I'm not sure I can
            just teach someone to play even the most simple songs in a few
            minutes. Or even a few hours!
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been playing the accordion for almost 2 years, so while I still
            feel like a beginner in certain ways, I at least feel somewhat
            comfortable with my instrument at this point. But how long did it
            take me to get to that point?
          </p>
          <p>
            It took quite a while for me to be able to play a song with both
            hands on the accordion. Like... at least around a month! And that
            was just to play <q>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</q>. A lot of that
            time was just getting used to the left side, and being able to
            reliably find my way to the C button each time. And
            <em>then</em> coordinating my hands together to play a song. It's a
            bit like juggling the first time you try it: something just clicks
            in your brain but until then it's super confusing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, if you're used to the piano or another instrument where
            both hands are essentially playing two parts of a song, you'll
            probably be able to learn accordion a lot faster. I think piano is
            actually a harder instrument than the accordion in theory, as you're
            likely to find more complex phrases in the left hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            ...But when you first start out learning? I think accordion has a
            way steeper learning curve. Beginner songs on piano have a very
            static left hand; you usually end up holding down just one chord for
            an entire measure while you play the melody on the right hand. That
            doesn't really fly on the accordion though, the left side of the
            accordion tends to drown out the right side if you just hold down a
            chord while trying to play a melody over top of it. A beginner
            accordion song will typically have a basic <em>staccato</em>
            <q>oom-pah-pah</q> phrase in the left hand which just requires more
            movement. In order to really play a complete song, you
            <em>need</em> to get a handle on coordinating your hands way more
            immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyways... how long does it take to learn the accordion? It varies
            from person to person but I think it's normal to take a month or
            even more to learn your first real song that uses both hands. It
            takes a long time, but once you get used to coordinating your hands,
            it gets easier to pick up new songs!
