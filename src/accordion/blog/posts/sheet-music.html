          <p>
            Before I started learning the accordion, I assumed that the
            accordion was essentially equivalent to the piano in terms of its
            versatility. I mean, a lot of accordions <em>literally</em> have a
            sideways piano already on them, and there are way more buttons on
            the left side then there are on a standard keyboard! In that sense,
            it was easy to also assume that you could take any piano sheet music
            and play it on accordion.
          </p>
          <p>
            This... is generally not true. While the right side of the accordion
            <em>is</em> a piano
            <small
              >(or, in the case of button accordions, it is at least equivalent
              to pianos)</small
            >
            the left side is where things get way trickier. Most accordions use
            the <strong>stradella bass system,</strong> which is
            <em>not</em> fully capable of playing what you can with your left
            hand on a normal piano. The stradella bass system exposes only one
            octave of actual notes, and the rest of the buttons are chords. This
            system makes playing chords and switching between them much easier,
            but it does remove some of the freedom you have with a full piano,
            and as such, you cannot just play the bass part of any song on piano
            perfectly on accordion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some accordions do not use the stradella system, but instead use
            <strong>free bass,</strong> which does not feature chord buttons and
            instead each button maps to individual notes. Modern accordions with
            free bass generally can switch between stradella and free bass
            systems with register switches, and these are called
            <strong>free bass converter</strong> accordions. In theory, under
            the free bass system you could recreate the bass part of most piano
            compositions on the accordion, as long as the notes are within a
            normal bass range anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            But... you have to keep in mind that on the left side of the
            accordion, you are completely blind and are relying only on touch
            and muscle memory to press the right buttons. This makes it
            <em>much</em> harder to play free bass. While most songs are
            theoretically possible on the free bass system, you have to take
            into account the practicality of playing the songs as well. And
            that's if you even <em>have</em> a free bass accordion or converter
            to begin with!
          </p>
          <p>
            Back to the stradella system, how do those with stradella bass
            accordions find sheet music for songs? Most
            <q>accordion standards</q> such as the Beer Barrel Polka or
            Libertango are easy to find sheet music for. But in general, if a
            song was already written for the accordion, you'll generally be able
            to find sheet music pretty easily just searching the web. For
            instance, you can find sheet music for
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrvZrBCR6-A"
              title="Oh there's a shrine nearby!"
              >Kass's Theme</a
            >
            from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild online pretty easily.
            But that's because it was originally an accordion song so of course
            any sheet music you find will be appropriate for accordionists.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real challenge is finding sheet music for songs that
            <em>aren't</em> originally for accordion. The accordion isn't
            <em>that</em> popular of an instrument, so if you do a web search
            for <q><i>[insert popular song here]</i> accordion sheet music</q>,
            you're not likely to find premade accordion sheet music. There are
            definitely some resources out there, and sometimes I get surprised
            by random sites on the web. But if you're into more niche music,
            <span
              title='Okay, anime music isn&apos;t exactly "niche", but you have to understand that a lot of accordionists in the English speaking world are old men who would not know what the hell a Zelda even is'
              >like anime or video game stuff as an example,</span
            >
            you're essentially completely out of luck.
          </p>
          <p>
            And here lies the challenge of learning your favorite songs on
            accordion:
            <strong
              >Most of the time, you have to arrange it for accordion
              yourself.</strong
            >
            This can either involve learning songs by ear or by using existing
            piano sheet music or even just guitar chords to assist in
            arrangement. I feel like arranging songs for your instrument is a
            skill that you have to practice and refine just as much as being
            able to actually play the instrument. I am definitely still trying
            to improve in this area, and much like how there are songs I'm not
            skilled enough to play on the accordion yet, there are a songs I
            want to arrange for accordion but I'm not skilled enough in
            arrangement to really do them justice yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Something I find motivating is how uncommon the accordion is, at
            least compared to piano and guitar. If you have a really niche song
            you want to do an accordion cover of, there's serious potential that
            you might be one of only a handful of people on the planet who would
            actually be willing to make an accordion arrangement of it. In such
            a scenario I almost feel like I have a duty to make an
            arrangement... if I don't do it, <em>no one else will.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            ...By the way, here's a protip for arranging songs on accordion.
            Basically any song on 3/4 time is going to sound good on accordion
            and it'll pretty easy to arrange. Just replace the bass section of
            each with the standard <q><em>oom-pah-pah</em></q> pattern on
            whichever chord fit the original measure
            <small
              >(which a lot of the times, is just going to be the first note of
              that measure!)</small
            >. This process is so simple, that often times I can just print out
            original piano sheet music for songs in 3/4 time and play the songs
            on accordion by converting on the fly while I read the sheet music.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyways, if you're learning the accordion, I wish you luck in
            playing songs no one else has ever played on an accordion before
            you. &lt;3
