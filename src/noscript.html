    <h1>Javascript Info</h1>
    <p>
      Hey! It seems you may have Javascript disabled or blocked.
      <noscript>(Actually, I can see it's specifically disabled lol)</noscript>
      That's fine! I tried to not put too many wacky effects on the screen, and
      also I don't have any tracking scripts present on the page, so if you
      trust me, you can enable Javascript on this page and I promise nothing bad
      will happen and I won't track you or steal your data or cookies or
      whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Also I suggest using Firefox + Duck Duck Go Privacy Essentials so you can
      enjoy the web with little scripts here and still not be tracked by
      scripts!)
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to design this website to degrade at least somewhat gracefully
      when you disable scripts (which I assume is how you found this page), so
      if you see a page that is <em>completely</em> broken, please
      <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me and I'll try to fix things! Thanks!
    </p>
    <p>
      (If you got to this page with JS enabled... I guess it means you probably
      navigated to this page from the sitemap. If you got to this page some
      other way... please update your browser?)
    </p>
