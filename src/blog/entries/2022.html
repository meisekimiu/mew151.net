        <h2>Disorganized Ramblings On 2022</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-01-07">Posted 2023年1月7日</time>
        <p>
          I joined Tumblr on a whim back in 2019, and ever since then, every new
          year I have posted a recap on my
          <a

            title="Seriously though... please ignore that I have a Tumblr. Centralized social media bad."
            >that year</a
          >
          to my Tumblr blog. I love doing these little recaps because they kind
          of act as little time capsules... records of past years and the games
          I played within them. 2019 wasn't <em>that</em> long ago in the grand
          scheme of things, but when I look at the games I played and how I
          emotionally responded to them at the time, it's surprising how far
          away 2019 was. It feels like an eternity ago. I'm sure one day in the
          future I'd love to look back at 2022's list of games and see how
          different I was back then.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>...But...</em> I can't really write up a games list this year...
          so I wrote this whole article instead.
        </p>
        <h3>The Games I <del>Played</del> in 2022</h3>
        <p>
          The main problem is just that I didn't really play many games this
          year. And of the games I did play, I hardly finished any.
          <a href="https://squishymoss.itch.io/momosdiary" title="*squeak*"
            >momosdiary</a
          >
          was an interesting visual novel I did complete this year, but I'm not
          sure I want it to represent the year 2022 for me (because of its
          rather depressing nature).
          <a
            href="https://npckc.itch.io/mima-and-ninas-chocolate-workshop"
            title="I think at one point I had to brute force the final ending lol"
            >Mima and Nina's Chocolate Workshop</a
          >
          was another cute VN I finished this year, and this one isn't even
          depressing! But still... it doesn't feel like "favorite game this
          year" material to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at more AAA releases, there was
          <a
            href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch/"
            title="I swear I wanted to make a MLP fangame with like the exact visual theme of this game years ago"
            >that one 3D kirby game that came out,</a
          >
          but I only got about 25% of the way through it. Persona 5 finally came
          to a platform I own, but my backlog is still too big to start a new
          game. Really the only big
          <span title="Maybe not AAA in quality...">AAA game</span> I played
          throughout this year was
          <a
            href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/"
            title="This should have been the only Pok&eacute;mon game that came out this year"
            >Pok&eacute;mon Legends: Arceus.</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought <em>Pok&eacute;mon Legends: Arceus</em> was a fun and fresh
          take on the franchise. It was very, <em>very</em> obviously derivative
          of Breath of the Wild, but compared to the modern Pok&eacute;mon games
          I've played on the Switch, that's actually a good thing. For the first
          time, I played a Pok&eacute;mon game that actually felt like how I
          imagined future Pok&eacute;mon games would be like as a kid. I wish
          more time could have been spent on it, because I think this game was
          basically treated as a stepping stone to <em>Scarlet</em> and
          <em>Violet</em> which came out later in the year. I think if
          <em>Arceus</em> was allowed to be <em>the</em> Pok&eacute;mon release
          of this year, it'd be an even stronger game.
        </p>
        <h3>Things I Did (And Didn't) Do in 2022</h3>
        <p>
          Outside of games, 2022 was a really... interesting year for me. While
          2020 was just a chaotic mess, and 2021 was a year full of positive
          changes, 2022 felt... strange and stuck in a lot of ways?
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't end up putting out any games during 2022, after finally
          getting back into game development in 2020. Instead 2022 was a year of
          reflecting on the technology I use to build games and practicing with
          new technologies instead. I guess from that I've built momentum to
          make more games in 2023 now... but we'll see if I actually get around
          to that!
        </p>
        <p>
          What I <em>did</em> do during 2022 was focus on the indie web. Early
          in 2022, with Bo Burnham's
          <q
            ><a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU"
              title="WELCOME!"
              >Welcome to the Internet</a
            ></q
          >
          echoing in my head, I finally launched my personal website and
          redesigned blog (which you're reading right now!). I dove into
          Neocities and explored a refreshingly free, personal, and lightweight
          world wide web. I'm so, <em>so</em> happy I finally actually have a
          personal homepage instead of the blank page that
          <a href="https://mew151.net" title="(YOU ARE HERE)">Mew151.net</a> was
          for the previous 13 years. I think when I reflect back on the year
          2022, I'll always remember the memories of exploring Neocities and
          other parts of the Indie Web. &lt;3
        </p>
        <p>
          Making a personal website wasn't the only way I turned my back to
          centralized social media in 2022. I also joined The Fediverse this
          year, self-hosting my own microblog so my social media presence
          doesn't have to be owned by a corporation. I've already written
          <a
            href="https://blog.mew151.net/entries/fediverse-1.html"
            title="After more time spent on the Fediverse, I can report back that the graph in this post is still accurate"
            >enough</a
          >
          <a
            href="https://blog.mew151.net/entries/fediverse-2.html"
            title="Half of this article is just me begging people to give fedi a try. Well. That's really what half of my entire 2022 was."
            >articles</a
          >
          about The Fediverse on my blog as is, so I don't really need to go
          into details. But I'm glad I finally have it a try! I was so
          intimidated by Mastodon at first, but I really have grown to love the
          community <small>...for the most part.</small> All I'll say is... if
          you haven't tried it yet, give it a try!
        </p>
        <p>
          In more <q><kbd>touch grass</kbd></q> kinds of experiences, I traveled
          quite a bit in 2022! In May I visited San Francisco to see The
          Residents'
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA_pvUOqWzA"
            title="fluttered down it fluttered down it fluttered down it fluttered down..."
            >God In Three Persons live show.</a
          >
          I loved SF and I hope to visit again some day! Walking to Presidio
          Theater for the shows was kind of magical, and I did so much in that
          long weekend I was there. Without a doubt one of my favorite travel
          experiences and so far still my only solo travel experience!
        </p>
        <p>
          This year I also visited Austin,
          <span
            title="As someone who likes to watch videos on urbanism... let me tell you. The rural south? Personally not for me!!!"
            >South Carolina,</span
          >
          and Tucson. Tucson I visited twice and each visit had its own unique
          <small>(sometimes in bad ways)</small> vibes... but I still have yet
          to eat a good

            >Sonoran Dog</a

          while I'm there. I guess I'll have to try again in 2023.
        </p>
        <h3>The Strange Vibes of 2022</h3>
        <p>
          Something strange happened to me in 2022. It was something that had
          been building up for a while the last few years, but it finally hit me
          with real clarity for the first time in 2022. I had this realization,
          one that I'm sure most people who are older than me have already had:
          <span
            title="I'm sure there's a word in the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows that fits this"
            >the realization that the era I grew up in is, to our current
            culture, an aged and bygone era.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not <em>that</em> old, I'm still in my mid-20's as of writing. But
          2022 was the year when I could look at things from the 2000's and see
          them as aged artifacts that you don't see anymore. I stared at a
          purple Gamecube controller in my hands and realized how... Y2K it
          looked? They would never make a controller like this today
          <small>(if it weren't for Smash Bros, anyway)</small>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I get this feeling with the actual game software of this era as well.
          <em>Animal Crossing</em> has certain elements to it that have been
          polished out of its more modern releases. There is a certain...
          <em>je ne sais quoi </em> to the UI of a lot of sixth-generation
          console games that just... doesn't exist anymore. And it's hard to
          explain exactly <em>what</em> that is. They just don't make games like
          that anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a certain Gamecube-era aesthetic I find truly breathtaking,
          but I don't even know how to describe it. Maybe 2023 will be the year
          I'll find the words for it and do a write-up on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also bought an
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Mavica"
            title="Mavica? ...I hardly know her?"
            >old digital camera</a
          >
          this year. And yes, it's most definitely related to the previous
          existential feelings I just talked about. I'm absolutely floored by
          the look of photos from old digital cameras. I assume this is how
          older folks felt about retro polaroid filters when those came out on
          the Instagrams and such. There is something so haunting about seeing
          these pictures and the realization that I <em>used</em> to see
          pictures that looked like this all the time and... I no longer do? My
          brain still gets tripped up when I take a picture of modern technology
          with these old cameras.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words... back in MY day, stuff looked different! And now it
          looks weird and old! That's it.
        </p>
        <h3>So... It's 2023</h3>
        <p>
          I want to focus more on actually doing more in 2023. While I
          <em>did</em> do a lot in 2022, I didn't really enter the year with any
          goals and just stumbled into things I ended up doing. This year I want
          to accomplish more specific things and I do have some goals for the
          year.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I want to focus more on writing music this year, and I'm challenging
            myself to write a few songs each month
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to learn more about 3D Game Development, including the
            mathematics behind it, but also learning how to use Blender maybe?
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to get more comfortable in C++ again, after mostly making
            games in Typescript lately
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to release at least one new game in 2023, hopefully a
            specific project I have currently codenamed
            <em>Cosmetics Project</em>
          </li>
          <li>I want to enter a 100km bike race!</li>
          <li>Probably lots of other things too</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Yeah... there's a lot of focus on Game Development this year and less
          of a focus on my personal website. I still want to work on that too,
          but after taking a break from game dev for most of 2022, I really want
          to get back into it and work on some more stuff!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Anyway... hope your 2022 was good, and I hope everyone has a good
          2023! This was an unorganized rant, and I'm off to chase after the sun
          in this new year!
