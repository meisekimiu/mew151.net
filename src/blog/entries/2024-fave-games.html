            >2022,</a
          >
          I kind of stopped playing games for a bit. 2023 was much the same and
          so I didn't end up writing up anything. But!
          <span

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Like usual, this list includes any games I played this year,
          regardless of their original release year. I also have TWO bonus
          mentions which are games I didn't really like but still wanted to
          write about!
        </p>
        <h3 id="bowsers-fury">(Dis)honorable Mention: <i>Bowser's Fury</i></h3>
        <p>
          When <i>Bowser's Fury</i> released in 2021, I heard a lot of comments
          on how it was ushering in a new era of 3D Mario. "It's basically a new
          3D Mario game!" "This is what the future of Mario looks like" "If you
          love 3D Mario, you have to play this". Well a few years after it
          released I finally rolled credits on <i>Bowser's Fury</i> and I gotta
          say... I'm not a big fan!
        </p>
        <p>
          I love 3D Mario games but <i>Bowser's Fury</i> just kind of annoys me.
          For years I've been critical of <i>Super Mario 3D World</i>'s limited
          controls and level design, because I always found the more free and
          expressive movement in other 3D Mario games to be way more fun. But I
          do have to give credit where it's due: at least
          <i>Mario 3D World's</i> level design and controls were developed in
          harmony with each other. <i>Bowser's Fury</i> is an intriguing sales
          pitch: the gameplay of <i>3D World</i> but with way more open world
          level design. But it kept feeling like the controls were designed for
          a completely different game... because they were! I don't usually have
          to "fight the controls" while playing a Mario game, but this one is
          the exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel like the game also has a lot of little annoyances that add up.
          The game doesn't really encourage doing 100% completions of each
          little area all in a row, but instead encourages you to venture from
          area to area and slowly loop back on older ones to eventually 100%
          them all. But why? Why am I discouraged from playing like this? Why do
          I have to sit around and just <i>wait</i> for Bowser to destroy a
          block in every single area? Why do I have to manually leave a level to
          reset it, can't it just boot me back to the beginning like Mario 64?
          Since most level layouts are reused, it means I keep having to do the
          same linear platforming challenges over and over again for different
          shines.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span title="You hear that jan Misali?!"
            >It's an interesting experience but in my opinion it's always going
            to be an extra thing tied to 3D World instead of its own
            release.</span

        <h3 id="bionicle">
          Bonus Dishonorable Mention: <i>Bionicle The Game</i>
        </h3>
        <p>
          This year I played a couple of games that I was never able to beat as
          a child with horrible hand-eye coordination. One of these games was
          <i>Bionicle</i> for the Gamecube. This game is not very good, as one
          would expect. It's pretty short and I feel like it misses one of the
          main appeals of Bionicle: the world! Running through levels to defeat
          bad guys as a hero character is cool, but where are the villages?
        </p>
        <p>
          In video games there is a weird pattern that a small fraction of
          players will follow that most developers will never even consider or
          account for at all. If your game has the capabilities, children will
          use your game as dolls. They will roleplay a completely different
          story with the on-screen characters. They will play house. They will
          find a way to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think <i>Bionicle</i> kind of lacks this capability though. The
          levels are a bit too linear and boring for this to really work. This
          is a very niche complaint but I think it's one reason why I didn't
          like this game as a child. (I mainly don't like it as an adult
          because. Well it's a low budget licensed children's game for Gamecube.
          There was no way this game would be good)
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Now that some dishonorable mentions are out of the way... let's talk
          about the games I really did enjoy!
        </p>
        <h3>5. <i>Splatoon 3 + Side Order</i></h3>
        <p>
          I finally beat the story mode of <i>Splatoon 3</i> this year! The
          story mode on this game was mainly a "I'm waiting at the gate at the
          airport" type distraction so it took me forever to finish it. It was
          fun! I'm glad that they decided to replicate <i>Splatoon 2's</i> Octo
          Expansion instead of its original campaign but... it kind of felt a
          bit too much like a copy of it at times. Regardless it was fun, and
          the final moments were the kind of special wackiness that felt absent
          from <i>Splatoon 2's</i> main story mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          I happened to finish this story mode right as <i>Side Order</i> came
          out so I played that too. And I gotta say... I kind of get why the hip
          thing in gaming right now is The Roguelite. I get it. It makes every
          moment of gameplay way more engaging because this could be
          <i>the run</i> that wins! I think this Roguelite treatment fits
          Splatoon's gameplay pretty well too. I am hoping that if there's a
          <i>Splatoon 4</i> that it doesn't copy this roguelite formula for its
          story mode. But still! Very fun and if I was a kid with all the time
          in the world I'd totally try to 100% complete <i>Side Order.</i> As an
          adult? I'm happy just beating it once.
        </p>
        <h3 id="paper-mario">4. <i>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</i></h3>
        <p>
          They made Vivian transgender. They put a transgender in my favorite
          childhood video game. :')
        </p>
        <p>
          But seriously though revisiting this game on Switch was fun. I think
          there's this idea that remakes of games are low effort cash grabs. And
          it's definitely true that remaking a game is often easier than making
          a completely new game from scratch, I do think that people tend to
          underestimate the work that goes into a remake. All of the things they
          added or changed aesthetically in this remake are great. I especially
          love all of the concept art you can unlock which really gives you a
          look into both original development and the work that went into the
          remake.
        </p>

        <h3 id="until-then">3. <i>Until Then</i></h3>
        <p>
          I initially heard of this game from a Godot engine showcase video. I
          have to say, while it doesn't matter to the player at all, I like what
          this game is built out of. It was a pleasant surprise to see that they
          also used Inkle's Ink to make this game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, if you're looking to play a Makoto Shinkai-esque story set in
          the Philippines, play <i>Until Then</i>! I loved how explorable the
          game's social media feed is in particular. I don't want to spoil too
          much of the game so I won't go into much more detail, but I love all
          the characters in the game. I almost got faked out when the credits
          rolled for the first time.
        </p>
        <h3 id="emio">
          2. <i>Famicom Detective Club - Emio: The Smiling Man</i>
        </h3>
        <p>
          It's been a while since a game announcement has actually made me
          excited. Maybe I've been burnt too many times. Maybe it's just that
          the Nintendo Switch has most of what I could ask for at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the mysterious
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhwwG-QvGQ"
            title="rip to all the people who thought it was silent hill or whatever. the dozen famicom detective club fans win this time"
            >"Emio" trailer</a
          >
          was revealed to be for a new <i>Famicom Detective Club</i> game, I was
          in a good mood for the entire week. A brand new game in the series was
          at the top of my "most wanted Nintendo Direct announcements" for the
          last few years. And we finally got it!
        </p>
        <p>
          And well, this game really is a brand new
          <i>Famicom Detective Club</i> game. I think it fits really well with
          the other two games in the series, despite the fact that they were
          made decades apart. I was hoping that the game might more
          fundamentally reimagine what one of these games with modern system
          specs, but it plays pretty much identically to the previous ones. So
          much so that I feel like a "demake" of the game to original Famicom
          hardware could be possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's actually the only disappointment I have for the game. One of
          the earlier games in the series has a small maze-navigation minigame
          near the end and I was really hoping that <i>Emio</i> would deliver a
          similar surprise minigame that was a bit more advanced in gameplay. It
          doesn't, but that's not a deal breaker.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be fair, <i>Emio</i> does deliver something that would have been
          impossible in the Famicom days and I think it's going to stick with me
          for a while. Like, one of the wildest post-games I've ever experienced
          in a game ever, and probably will ever experience. Buy Emio please
          they need to make more of these.
        </p>
        <h3 id="holy-magic-century">1. <i>Quest 64 / Holy Magic Century</i></h3>
        <p>This one's really getting the number 1 spot on my list, huh?</p>
        <p>
          I started off my games backlog this year by playing through
          <i>Quest 64</i>, a game that my family has owned for as long as I
          remember. Despite this, I've never seen very far into the game. I'd
          get through the first town and give up playing pretty quickly, and my
          family would pretty much do the same. But there was something about
          this game that haunted me over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some reason, I am fascinated by generic, yet more obscure and old
          JRPGs. I do not know why this is the case. I don't even really like
          JRPGs. But <i>Quest 64</i> fits that mold and it called out to me.
          There is something thrilling about playing a game like this because it
          feels like you're truly exploring something that not many people have
          seen. There's a bit of wonder that comes from not knowing where this
          game is going. I dunno.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Holy Magic Century</i> (the name that <i>Quest 64</i> fans usually
          use because it sounds more fitting) is a very ambitious game. In many
          ways it's <i>incredibly</i> ahead of its time. This is a fully 3D JRPG
          where battles take place in the overworld (this isn't saying much, but
          Pokemon didn't achieve that until 2022!). And when I say it's 3D I
          mean it's fully polygonal 3D. No pre-rendered environments like<i>
            Ocarina of Time</i
          >
          or<i> Final Fantasy 7.</i> Most NPCs have some kind of unique
          appearance, and there are many completely bespoke NPC models. The
          camera control is... fine for the time. There are not too many blatant
          glitches. The battle system is novel and has a fun learning curve. At
          times it feels like I'm playing a JRPG from the PS2/Gamecube era
          instead of the Nintendo 64. The moment-to-moment gameplay is
          surprisingly solid.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems like I'm praising the game to no end but let me be clear.
          While I think <i>Holy Magic Century</i> has impressive technical
          ambitions that rival or maybe even surpass what
          <i>Ocarina of Time</i> or <i>Final Fantasy 7</i> do, it's important to
          note one big difference: <i>Ocarina</i> and <i>FF7</i> were actually
          finished. They have to resort to pre-rendered background environments,
          but those environments are at least fun to explore around! They
          actually tell a story! They add up to make a memorable game! I cannot
          say the same thing for <i>Holy Magic Century's</i> impressive but
          unfinished polygonal world.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Holy Magic Century</i>'s world feels like a barren wasteland at
          times. The pretentious part of my brain almost tried to interpret this
          as an intentional artistic choice ("is this a game that's about
          emptiness?") but as you play the game and research its development
          it's clear the world is shaped by the limitations of time and budget
          and overambition. As you get through the game these limitations become
          more and more visible. You see that the once-novel battle system
          starts to get old and tired once you've realized you've seen all there
          is to see with it and you're only halfway through the game. You can
          tell which characters would have joined your party if they managed to
          finish that part of the game. You can see other traces of mechanics
          that should be in the game but were never implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know a small group of people will defend this game to death and hate
          it when people say "<i>Quest 64 </i>doesn't have a story" but like...
          it's kind of true? There are hints of a story.
          <span
            title="this reference is a bit inappropriate since Quest 64's story is orders of magnitude more developed than Donald Trump's plan for healthcare"
            style="text-decoration: line-through"
            >Concepts of a plan</span
          >. But as someone who was truly, actively trying to engage with the
          story... there was basically nothing here. The tiny hint of story we
          get at the end was a welcome surprise after basically nothing the
          whole time but that doesn't make up for the rest of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet... I still kind of liked it? When I beat the game I kept
          thinking of all the things I'd do in my next playthrough. Which... is
          kind of wild? This game is disappointing but it's disappointing in a
          very fascinating way. I feel like I've never seen such visible scope
          reduction in a finished video game in my life before. You can
          practically see which corners were cut. Which mechanics are
          essentially just bandages covering up ambitions never fully realized.
          It's really fascinating to play through and it's going to be a game
          that will continue to haunt me even after I thought I was finally done
          with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          ...Oh god I really became one of those people who's actually
          pretentious about this game. Fuck.
