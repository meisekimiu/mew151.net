        <h2>My Favorite Games I Played in 2025</h2>
        <time datetime="2025-12-31">Posted 2025年12月31日</time>
        <p>
          For a few years now, I've been trying to make posts about the games I
          played over the last few years. And here's 2025's! This year was a
          busy one for me so I didn't play as many games as

            >2024,</a

          but I still found plenty of time to play games in between making them.
          :) Anyways, let's talk about some games!

          Honorable Mention: ミラノのアルバイトこれくしょん (Milano's Odd Job
          Collection)
        </h3>
        <p>
          This was a cute and small game I played this month. It's bursting with
          character and feels a bit ahead of it's time for a Playstation game
          since it fits right in with "cozy" or "wholesome" games of today. I
          wish it were just a bit bigger in scope. Still, this game gets the
          very honorable "I would have been obsessed with this game as a kid"
          award! Plus this game features one of the most genius cat names of all
          time: ぺぺローニャ ("Pepperonya" in the JP version of the game)
        </p>
        <h3 id="natsumon">5. Natsu-Mon: 20th Century Summer Kid</h3>
        <p>
          Speaking of games that I would have loved as a kid,
          <em>Natsu-Mon</em> also feels like a game that would have occupied a
          whole summer vacation of my childhood if it existed for me to play
          back then. I think a lot of games released in the last few years have
          dealt with some sort of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>-ification and
          sometimes that's a positive and sometime's that's a negative.
          <em>Natsu-Mon</em> is the next <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi</em> series
          entry in a post-<em>Breath of the Wild</em> world and... it works
          well! Running around a large enivronment is the perfect way to spend a
          summer vacation and I think this game nails a "cozy" open world
          experience.
        </p>
        <h3 id="mkw">4. Mario Kart World</h3>
        <p>
          I got a Wii U in 2015 and <em>Mario Kart 8</em> was one of the games I
          quickly picked up for my system. And so began 10 long years of playing
          <em>Mario Kart 8</em> and dreaming about what the <em>next</em> Mario
          Kart game would be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well we finally have it and... it's alright! I think there are some
          super cool additions to this game: the movement mechanics are amazing,
          the full tracks are all pretty great, the wonderful music?! I think
          they dropped the ball in a few places: the routes between tracks are
          not as fun as the tracks themselves, in a game whose theme is road
          trips you can't make track "playlists" in advance, no way to play only
          tracks on random. But these negatives are pretty specific complaints
          mainly from the perspective of people who take Mario Kart a bit too
          seriously (like myself). As far as the casual experience goes, I think
          this one's a great time with friends especially if you're not exactly
          sober while playing.
        </p>
        <h3 id="totk">3. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3>
        <p>
          When <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> launched in 2023 I was excited but
          I ended up only playing it intermittently. There was intrigue in the
          story and the new mechanics were pretty fun, but I think I was tired
          of the big open world and <em>Tears of the Kingdom's</em> world is
          even bigger than its predecessor.
        </p>
        <p>
          After getting a Switch 2 this year I started playing the upgraded
          version of this game and... I think I'm officially a framerate snob
          because being able to play at 60fps reduced a lot of the friction I
          had in this game. I've really enjoyed my time playing the game this
          year and my opinion on the game has changed dramatically now that I've
          put more time into it. Now that I've cleared a lot of the main story I
          think I now officially enjoy <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> more than
          <em>Breath of the Wild</em> since I think all the mechanics fit
          together in a much more satisfying way.
        </p>
        <p>
          My only complaint is that there is no Kass and therefore no
          accordionist representation in this game. So actually this game gets a
          0/10 for me.
        </p>
        <h3 id="mp4">2. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>
        <p>
          Remember when <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> was announced at E3 2017?
          Imagine telling me that I'd get a game dev job before it came out...
        </p>
        <p>
          Close to its release, <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> generated a bit
          of controversy among People Who Feel The Need To Be Angry At Metroid
          Games Online (otherwise known as "Metroid fans"). Having played the
          game, was this pre-emptive criticism justified? ...Eh, not really in
          my opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> does have some missteps
          (tutorials are a bit overbearing, the desert should have been at least
          a bit more fun, and it ended up feeling a bit <em>too</em> linear for
          a Metroid game) but I really did enjoy the experience of playing it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite any problems I had with it, I still kept thinking about "the
          next time" I would play the game in the back of my mind. And for some
          reason it's always those games that I keep thinking about years later.
        </p>
        <p>That being said... it's still not as good as the next game:</p>
        <h3 id="mpr">1. Metroid Prime Remastered</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> wasn't the only game in 2023 that I
          picked up and then stopped playing. When
          <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> dropped in 2023, I also picked that
          up and enjoyed my time with it. But I ended up stopping for some
          personal reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2025, I picked the game up again and actually cleared it this time.
          And wow. <em>Metroid Prime</em> is an incredible game and the Switch
          remaster makes it look even more beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The level design in this game is just immaculate and I loved poking
          around every nook and cranny to find all of the items in this game. I
          also love how the game's main objective (collecting the hidden
          artifacts) plays out as a non-linear scavenger hunt. It all plays
          together very nicely. They should try doing that again some time!
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel like of the games Nintendo has put out, there are some that
          gain a more legendary reputation than others.
          <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em>,
          <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, <em>Earthbound</em>, etc. Well I think it
          goes without saying that <em>Metroid Prime</em> deserves a spot on
          that list.
