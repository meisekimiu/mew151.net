        <h2>More Thoughts On The Fediverse (Fediverse Part 2)</h2>
        <time datetime="2022-07-19">Posted 2022年07月19日</time>
        <p>
          In
          <a
            href="fediverse-1.html"
            title="Elon Musk buying Twitter made me upset enough to actually write a blog post, can you believe it?"
            >my previous blog post,</a
          >
          I looked at various <q>Fediverse</q> server software from the
          perspective of self-hosting one's own social media feed. But it's been
          a few months and I've now spent actual time on the fediverse instead
          of just browsing through application documentation. So... what have I
          learned since then?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, first and foremost: <strong>The Fediverse is great.</strong> I
          strongly urge you to join it! But if you want to join, I have a word
          of advice for you!
        </p>
        <h3>If You Want To Join... Join a Small Instance</h3>
        <p>
          In my previous post I mentioned that I was afraid to join smaller,
          more specific instances in fear of going off-topic. That was an
          irrational fear. There are many themed instances out there, dedicated
          to stuff like art, video games, coffee,
          <del>vore,</del> and miscellaneous interests. But the themes are
          really only there with the intention of finding likeminded people.
          You're not supposed to <em>only</em> post about coffee on the
          coffee-themed instance. It's an instance for people who like coffee to
          post about... well whatever!
        </p>
        <p>
          <span
            title="Originally I wrote a whole rant here about mastodon.social but I checked and they re-enabled the local and federated timelines."
            >A concern I have for anyone joining the Fediverse is that they join
            a huge instance that doesn't have a local or federated timeline, and
            get frustrated when they can't find anyone to follow and quit.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the best things about the fediverse is that there are multiple
          kinds of timelines. In addition to your <q>home</q> timeline, which
          shows posts from your followed accounts (much like how Twitter works
          but without the ads and other algorithmic garbage), there are usually
          at least two other timelines you can view: the Local Timeline and the
          Federated Timeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Local Timeline shows posts from other users that are also on your
          instance. This is a great place to meet new people, especially if
          you're on one of those small themed instances where you all have
          something in common with each other. I like to think of other users on
          your instance as your <q>neighbors</q> all living in a big apartment
          building. You all share the same building and can run into each other
          or even have little community events, but you also have your own
          private apartments as well. The idea of
          <q>Twitter, but with neighbors</q> is kind of a weird concept at
          first, but it's so much fun if you're on the right instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Federated Timeline shows posts from the instances
          <q>known network</q>. It's kind of like everyone's timelines all
          pooled together into one super-chaotic firehouse of posts (it's a bit
          more complicated than that, but that's the basic idea). It's fun to
          see all kinds of different posts and discover new people to follow
          from there. On big enough instances, the chaos from all of this
          basically gives you constant access to new random posts and accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think both of these timelines are important for discoverability,
          which is more necessary without an evil algorithm trying to suggest
          content to you. If you're interested in the Fediverse, I
          <em>beg</em> you to join a smaller instance if possible; you
          <em>need</em> local and federated timelines to really have fun. In a
          way it reminds me of the Neocities UI, which ends up feeding you the
          notifications for <em>anyone you're following...</em> but this random
          noise is the best way to discover new sites. Speaking of Neocities...
        </p>
        <h3>Personal Websites vs The Fediverse</h3>
        <p>
          I started my personal website to escape from centralized social media.
          While I'm hosting my website (including the blog here) through another
          host, I found the community on Neocities truly wonderful and have
          stumbled upon all kinds of cool websites thanks to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pace of content on Neocities was refreshingly slow compared to the
          hectic firehouse of algorithmically suggested content on mainstream
          centralized media. But... I have to admit... there was something about
          the concept of microblogging that I missed. I tried self-hosting a
          little microblog on my site via
          <a
            href="fediverse-1.html#twtxt"
            title="should I twtxt more or just replace the journal section with a fediverse feed"
            >twtxt,</a
          >
          but it was a lonely, inconvenient experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found the Fediverse to be a more fun, social, and convenient
          experience, and I love it! Honestly, to the point where I kind of
          started neglecting my website because the Fediverse ended up consuming
          my life instead. However, I've recently started working more on my
          website and exploring my Neocities feed again and... I have some
          <em>thoughts.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >The Fediverse will never be a replacement for personal
            websites.</strong
          >
          In my opinion they're the ultimate way to express yourself online.
          While The Fediverse is a great replacement for social media, I don't
          ever want my Fediverse profile to be the sole thing representing my
          online presence. Exploring personal sites on somewhere like Neocities
          is just so much more fun and immersive; instead of browsing a one
          dimensional feed of toots and boosts, you're browsing an entire
          <em>space.</em> A space that you can explore and get lost in.
        </p>
        <p>
          I mentioned that Fediverse instances can feel like
          <q>shared buildings</q> with <q>neighbors</q>. This is true, and I
          truly value those social connections. But personal websites really
          feel like you're visiting someone's actual living space. There's
          something cozy there that the Fediverse cannot replace. And likewise,
          personal websites cannot reliably replace everything that something
          like the Fediverse provides. Sometimes, you just want to share memes
          with friends and you <em>don't</em> want to dive through a whole
          website to do it. Personal websites are spaces that you can explore...
          but sometimes the one-dimensionality of toots and boosts is all that
          you want or need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, my takeaway is...
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgk-lA12FBk"
            title="sorry i don't speak spanish"
            >why not both?</a
          >
          I urge everyone to move away from centralized social media, and I
          think either a personal website <em>or</em> an account on a Fediverse
          instance are good ways to do it. But if you're extremely online enough
          to have either a Neocities <span title="xor">or</span> a Fediverse
          presence but not both, I think having both isn't a bad thing! They're
          both good fun!
        </p>
        <h3>The Administrative Experience</h3>
        <p>
          This blog post is getting pretty long and meandering, but I want to
          touch on one more thing real quick: While I compared the feature sets
          of various Fediverse server software in the previous blog post, one
          thing that I didn't really explore was how easy it was to set up and
          manage a server with each software. So now that I run my own
          instance... let me discuss my findings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never tried setting up a Mastodon instance, but I ended up setting
          up both Pleroma (or rather,
          <a
            href="https://coffee-and-dreams.uk/development/2022/06/24/akkoma.html"
            title="akkoma nuts"
            >Akkoma</a
          >) and Misskey instances. Initially I wanted Misskey since that was my
          takeaway from my previous post... but I ended up not getting it up
          initially. I even tried running it in Docker and it still didn't
          work??? One issue with Misskey is that a lot of the documentation is
          still only in Japanese, so some troubleshooting as an English speaker
          can be a <em>bit</em> more difficult. Something that really helps is
          searching the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/issues"
            title="I don't know why it took me so long to go here for help"
            >Github issues page for Misskey</a
          >
          if you run into any trouble, since the official documentation,
          especially in English, can be behind sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pleroma (but again to be clear, actually
          <a
            href="https://coffee-and-dreams.uk/development/2022/06/24/akkoma.html"
            title="akkoma? i hardly know her"
            >Akkoma</a
          >) on the other hand, was much easier to set up. It was kind of
          shocking how easy it was, especially
          <span
            title="i use arch btw, but my server was running Debian because I saw how easy looking the Pleroma install looked on Debian lol"
            >on Debian</span
          >
          <a
            href="https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/otp_en/"
            title="Now shipping my OTP"
            >with the OTP release.</a
          >
          I got Pleroma (still
          <a
            href="https://coffee-and-dreams.uk/development/2022/06/24/akkoma.html"
            title="i'd like to interject for a moment. what you're refering to as akkoma is actually pleroma/akkoma (or as i've taken to calling it recently, pleroma+akkoma)"
            >Akkoma</a
          >
          though) running painlessly and I set up my instance! So Pleroma/Akkoma
          definitely gets points in the <q>ease of installation</q> category,
          which I didn't account for before.
        </p>
        <p>
          However... Pleroma/Akkoma come with their own problems. While Akkoma
          has made and will continue to make improvements in this area, I have
          to say that the default frontend for Pleroma is... kind of bad? I
          mean, it's not <em>horrible,</em> but it's definitely built for people
          who already used Mastodon and want to move onto something else, and
          not for complete Fediverse noobs. I wanted my instance to be a place
          where I could invite any friends who want to try out the Fediverse for
          themselves, and I didn't really want Pleroma's default front end to be
          their first experience with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That fact alone made me debug all my issues and replace my Akkoma
          instance with a Misskey instance. Once I found out what was wrong with
          my configuration, setting up Misskey was pretty easy, but it took a
          bit to figure out what was wrong. I think that was a good trade off
          though, because Misskey's user interface is generally much friendlier
          than Pleroma's. I also recommend Misskey for anyone wanting to host a
          Fediverse instance for the
          <q>steal emojis from other servers</q> functionality alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of hosting things like instance logos, custom styles, and
          listing out things like federation rules or terms of service, Pleroma
          lets you edit all of those things within a static folder on your
          server. Assets in Misskey, on the other hand, seem to stay abstracted
          away in Misskey, as things like my instance logo are just uploaded to
          my admin account's drive (and my Terms of Service are just a Page I
          made in Misskey). I think both approaches are valid here; Pleroma's
          approach is easier to understand if you're a programmer/sysadmin type
          and Misskey lets you manage assets without having to ssh into your
          server.
        </p>
        <p>In conclusion... idk, I like Misskey more than Pleroma I guess.</p>
