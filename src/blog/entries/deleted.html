        <p>
          Hello! If you've reached this page, it means you tried to access a URL
          that linked to my older blog! I've since redesigned my blog, and have
          migrated almost all of the posts over. But... well, some posts didn't
          make the cut and I thought they were maybe too cringe or didn't fit
          the direction of my current blog.
        </p>

        <p>
          Listen, I'm actually mostly against deletion of old shames. I think
          there's something meaningful in cringe, and I love seeing all the old
          stuff I've made to see how much I've grown. But the few posts I've
          deleted from this blog did not really contribute to the blog at all,
          and it just seemed like a waste of time to migrate them over. If you
          really want to see them, they're probably still up on the wayback
          machine. They're not <em>too</em> horrible, I just didn't want to
          bring them over.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyway, that's about it. Sorry! I hope you enjoy the rest of the blog
          though. :3

        But I will, without any context whatsoever, post the tiny footer text
        from the deleted posts here:

          <li>In programming, shipping is good. カップリング is bad.</li>
          <li>"SOMEONE IS OUT TO GET ME AND I'M FED UP WITH THIS BS!!"</li>
