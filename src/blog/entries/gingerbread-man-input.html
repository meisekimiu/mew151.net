        <h2>The Residents’ Gingerbread Man and Keyboard Input Weirdness</h2>
        <time datetime="2020-05-26 16:42-07:00">Posted 2020年5月26日</time>
        <p>
          In the README file packed in with The Residents' interactive
          <em>Gingerbread Man</em> CD-ROM software, good ol' Uncle Willie gives
          you some cryptic advice in operating the interactive movies:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <strong
            >Uncle Willie sez: If it hurts when you do that, then DON'T DO
            THAT!</strong
          ><br />
          (In other words, avoid the following...)<br />
          - If the Caps Lock key is down then the buttons don't work. This
          continually torments some of the slower testers around here.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Why don't the buttons work when Caps Lock is activated? I'm pretty
          sure <em>DOOM II</em>, released the same year, doesn't suddenly lock
          up if you accidentally hit caps lock... and since this is clearly
          written up in the README, it means that <em>someone</em> who worked on
          this game noticed this before it was shipped!
        </p>

        <p>
          So why did this happen and why wasn't it fixed? In this post I'd like
          to look at the code to examine why exactly they could have missed such
          an obvious error.
        </p>

        <h3>So why doesn't it work with Caps Lock?</h3>
        <p>
          Adobe Director's Lingo programming language can handle keyboard input
          in multiple ways. Keyboard event functions basically have a few
          magical variables they can use.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of these variables, called
          <code><span style="color: #0000bb">the keyCode</span></code>
          <small
            >(and yes, Lingo's verbose syntax means that articles can be
            randomly tossed around variable names like that)</small
          >
          returns a number called... well, the "Key Code" which represents the
          actual physical button being pressed on a keyboard. Analyzing the key
          code is the most effective way of handling most keyboard input (and
          mouse button input for that matter!) since key code just abstractly
          represents that button's pressed state, with no other information
          getting in the way of that. What that means is that if you, say, flip
          on Caps Lock, it won't have any effect on the key codes being thrown
          at your input handlers.
        </p>
        <p>
          However... there is another variable that input handlers can also
          used: the more simply-named
          <code><span style="color: #0000bb">the key</span></code> returns a
          single character string representing the actual ASCII character being
          input. What this means is that things like the Caps Lock and Shift
          keys will affect what value this
          <code><span style="color: #0000bb">the key</span></code> parameter
          holds! So, if you're using this parameter to check if, say, the
          <code>a</code> key is pressed, you'll have to check if
          <code
            ><span style="color: #0000bb">the key</span
            ><span style="color: #007700"> = </span
            ><span style="color: #dd0000">"a"</span
            ><span style="color: #007700"> or </span
            ><span style="color: #0000bb">the key</span
            ><span style="color: #007700"> = </span
            ><span style="color: #dd0000">"A"</span></code
          >. Yeesh, talk about verbose!
        </p>
        <h3>Okay, so they didn't use Key Codes? Is that it?</h3>
        <p>
          Not using keycodes is <em>one</em> reason why this seemingly glaring
          issue is present in the game. But as I demonstrated, you can still
          have "case insensitive" key detection in your code by using character
          strings. So were they really just too lazy to do this?
        </p>

        <p>
          Well... <em>kind of</em>. Because of the way the code in
          <em>Gingerbread Man</em> is organized, implementing this case
          insensitivity is way harder than it should be. Let me show you an
          example of some uncompiled code found in the actual game's files!

        <p>
          I'm not entirely sure how this code works since I don't have access to
          the entire game's codebase, only random snippets that were left
          uncompiled. However, it appears to be using Lingo's
          <code>case</code> syntax to run specific bits of code based on the
          ASCII character code being pressed (probably gotten by passing
          <code><span style="color: #007700">the key</span></code> into the
          <code><span style="color: #007700">charToNum()</span></code
          >). In Lingo, multiple cases can't point to the same block of code and
          you can't put logical expressions in them either. So to make things
          case insensitive with this input handling framework in place, you'll
          need to double up every single line of code... and there are a LOT of
          lines of code like this, since this code is duplicated for each
          character's Director movie.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's some more code that responds to actual alphabetical characters:

        <p>
          Now in this example we only had to add 5 more lines of code, but also
          remember that because of the way this is organized, we're adding extra
          code that needs to be maintained! If we want to redefine the
          functionality of the "A" key for instance, we'd have to make sure that
          both the lowercase <em>and</em> uppercase blocks of code are updated.
          I assume having horribly rigid code like this would seriously inhibit
          creative tinkerers like The Residents (and would probably just be very
          time consuming to fix everywhere since Director didn't exactly have
          the most robust development tools!), so in the end they just slapped a
          "<strong>DON'T TURN ON CAPS LOCK OR YOU'LL BREAK EVERYTHING!</strong>"
          into the README file that came with the software.
        </p>

        <h3>Well I guess that solves that mystery!</h3>

          Well, not quite. There is a bit of code that caught my eye in the

          These seem to be key bindings for debugging functions! This code
          defines two key behaviors: it makes the
          <code><kbd>\ (Backslash)</kbd></code> key print out the amount of free
          kilobytes in memory to Director's message window, and it makes the
          <code><kbd>| (Vertical Bar)</kbd></code> key print out what I assume
          to be a list of active objects belonging to the global scene to
          Director's message window.

          It's strange since on most keyboards, backslash and the vertical bar
          are on the same key and you have to actually press shift to type the
          vertical bar. This suggests that the programmer(s?) knew about this
          whole case insensitive input thing rather early on, and even took
          advantage of it to easily bind two debugging commands to the same key!
        </p>

        <p>
          (By the way, if anyone does have a copy of GBM and a computer that can
          run it, I'd be interested in seeing if this functionality is still
          enabled in the game. Perhaps the debug information is spit out to
          standard output and can be read if you launch the game from the
          command prompt?)

          I think this suggests that the whole Caps Lock issue was known pretty
          early on and they just straight up decided to ignore it. Maybe they
          designed the key handler like this early on and forgot later in
          development, until a tester couldn't get the game working with Caps
          Lock on? Or what if this software really <em>was</em> programmed by
          The Residents and as a result it is just kind of weird and clunky?
          Perhaps The Residents wanted to map separate behavior to the uppercase
          alphabet but stopped when they realized they couldn't really do much
          more, leaving uppercase letters to do mostly nothing at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          And yes, I did say they <em>mostly</em> do nothing, since it seems
          that uppercase <strong>F, M, and S</strong> keys actually
          <em>do</em> something, specifically set the "random speed" parameter
          of the global director object... I assume it's the exact amount of
          time that has to pass between random events occurring on their own in
          the game. F, M, and S stand for "Fast", "Medium", and "Slow"
          respectively... I would assume.

          I don't think this functionality is documented anywhere, and again,
          I'm not even sure it works in the final game (given how it's plastered
          everywhere in the code I think it might still be functional though).
          But I think it seems to indicate that the game was designed around
          this weird case sensitive input system. Personally I think that's a
          really weird design decision, but hey, if the README is to believed
          this software <em>was</em> programmed by The Residents so I guess that
          makes sense...

          So... that was a rather deep dive into how
          <em>The Gingerbread Man</em> probably handles keyboard input. This
          piece of software is such an anomaly to me as a Residents fan and
          computer programmer... and doing a deep dive like this leaves me only
          more puzzled as to why the developers designed the game in such way
          that you can't have caps lock on while playing it.
          <em>Gingerbread Man</em> was developed with the same technology as the
          other Residents CD-ROM projects, <em>Freak Show CD-ROM</em> and
          <em>Bad Day on the Midway</em>, but it was handled by a completely
          different development studio. I haven't looked at
          <em>Freak Show</em> yet, but I can tell just from how the available
          uncompiled code is laid out that <em>Bad Day</em> was... much better
          put together, to say the least.
        </p>

        <p>
          I found all of this while researching these Residents CD-ROMs (with
          the ultimate goal to document <em>Bad Day on the Midway</em> in its
          entirety) and I hope I can learn more interesting things about these
          games as I continue trying to dig through the game files. Thanks for
          reading!
