          What is Perfect Pop Star Academy? Well, it just happens to be my
          personal blog. Yeah. Unfortunately it is not an actual academy that
          teaches you how to be a perfect pop star. I apologize for the
          confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, this blog was powered by a fancy custom made PHP blogging
          engine. It was built to optimize writing blog posts while still giving
          me full control over their contents if I wanted to. Ultimately that
          became kind of a hassle, and writing new blog posts became way too
          complicated. I also spent time writing a commenting system that used
          Twitter for its authentication, and then no one ever used it... not
          even spam bots! That system broke at some point anyway, though.
        </p>
        <p>
          In early 2022, I finally decided to actually make myself a personal
          website. I'm not a super big fan of the blogging format anymore,
          because concepts like tags, sorting entries by date, and even having
          the concept of <q>entries</q> in the first place seems very limiting
          to me. For a lot of the things I wanted to post about online,
          envisioning things as just normal web pages felt a lot more freeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          ...But, sometimes I want to just post a little blog post now and then!
          This blog is mainly for random little
          <small
            >(but not
            <a href="https://www.mew151.net/journal.html">microscopic</a
            >)</small
          >
          things I want to write about that don't have a home elsewhere on my
          site.
        </p>
        <h3>Why is it called <q>Perfect Pop Star Academy</q>?</h3>
        <p>
          The name comes from two specific references I've jammed together in my
          head.
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creamy_Mami,_the_Magic_Angel#Internationalization"
            title="I really wish they put a citation here so I could site that instead"
            >Apparently,</a
          >
          the anime 『<ruby>魔法<rp>(</rp><rt>まほう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby
          >の<ruby>天使<rp>(</rp><rt>てんし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby
          >クリィミーマミ』 (<q>Creamy Mami, The Magical Angel</q>) was planned
          to be given an English localization under the name
          <q>Pretty Creamy the Perfect Pop Star</q>. I thought this was a
          particularly funny and charming name and will sometimes throw around
          the phrase <q>Perfect Pop Star</q> when talking about idol anime.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my favorite show, 『アイカツ!』 (<q>Aikatsu!</q>), being an anime
          all about a school for idols, it got the wheels turning in my head. I
          decided a funny theoretical localization name for the show would be
          <q>Perfect Pop Star Academy,</q> and I liked that name so much I
          decided to give it to my blog. I think blog names that seem kind of
          random like this are way cooler than just <q>My Blog</q> on a website.
